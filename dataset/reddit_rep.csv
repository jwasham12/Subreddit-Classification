First they had to make ""racist"" the worst thing you can possibly be on earth. Check.

Every time Trump cites a statistic about border security they are really pointing to it and saying, ""See you said something bad about the Hispanics, you are racist!!!""  This is about posturing. 

An agreement will come out of this, and eventually the bullshit agencies that suck up too much taxpayer money (like TSA) will go back to ""work"" and do their bullshit jobs, but the sting of ""they called us racist"" will stay around.

Hispanics are vital for both parties. This entire shitshow for the Democrats is about positioning for their hearts and minds."

Republican,Go to StopS66 to fight Feinstein’s “assault weapons” ban that dems introduced yesterday.,"Yesterday a gun ban was introduced by the beloved Diane Feinstein and her fellow NPC commies.

Anyone who cares about the constitution, the government getting even bigger, and individual rights being outlawed needs to go to StopS66.com and let your voice be heard.

Join FPC or GOA now! Not the NRA. The NRA keeps getting weaker and weaker on the 2A. GOA has a history of never backing down.

With guns in the hands of individuals, there will be tragedies. But when guns are ONLY in the hands of the GOVERNMENT? There will be genocides.

Don’t you think German Jews would’ve liked to have guns in the 1930s? 

Oh that’s right, Germany disarmed almost all of it’s citizens. We all know what happened next.

Do you trust the government? Do you think the lobbyists (aka bribers) have too much influence? Do you think the government upholds the highest moral standards of anyone? Can they even balance a budget? Didn’t think so.

Let our politicians know guns don’t kill people, PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE.

An inanimate object is not the issue. Do spoons make people fat? No. People choosing to stuff their cake holes with endless amounts of McD’s does.

Do (non self driving) cars kill people? No. People driving cars do.

If that’s not enough reasons to take action today, I’ll leave you with this. We have 4 boxes of liberty. 
1) the soap box 
2) the ballet box
3) the jury box
4) the ammo box

They are to be used in that order. Do not give the government unlimited power.

We the people should rule the government from the bottom up, not the top down. Do not give your guns to Feinstein and all the other dems who are trying to take over this country. Take action now."

I think Gen Powell said it best. 

""Good leadership involves responsibility to the welfare of the group, which means that some people will get angry at your actions and decisions.  It's inevitable if you're honorable. Trying to get everyone to like you is a sign of mediocrity: You'll avoid the tough decisions, you'll avoid confronting the people who need to be confronted, and you'll avoid offering differential rewards based on differential performance because some people might get upset. Ironically, by procrastinating on the difficult choices, by trying not to get anyone mad, and by treating everyone equally ""nicely"" regardless of their contributions, you'll simply ensure that the only people you'll wind up angering are the most creative and productive people in the organization"".

Republican,Why The Wall Is A Good Idea,"**Preamble**

Many people think the wall is inhumane or a waste. But the truth is it isn't a waste at all. 5B dollars is not much at all considering the effects that that money will go to. 

**The Effects** 

Illegal immigrants cost us 135B dollars a year according to the U.S taxpayers. We only get back about 19B dollars worth of taxes from them, money being wasted on people who either illegally crossed or overstayed. If we can get this wall up than we can cut the budget of immigration and put it into other things like homeless veterans or homeless citizens, America first. 

**Why It Should Be Built**

Considering how our money is being wasted on aliens we need the wall for that reason too. Not all of it is people who crossed the border on foot but a good portion is. A lot of drugs are being smuggled into the U.S by crossing the border a year. Illegal immigrants are 2x more likely to commit crimes than a U.S citizen, another reason why we need the wall.

**Other Solutions For Immigration**

Abide by the law, don't overstay your visa. A lot of immigrants overstay visas and we end up paying their welfare and they give us little to nothing in return. We need to deport the ones who don't abide by the law and who overstay visas. If you want a opportunity in the U.S do it legally. But I do think that the process should be quicker so people should have a good opportunity here, but not illegally"

Republican,President Trump can't be indicted on collusion charges. Fruit of the poison tree argument.,"The dossier upon which the investigation into alleged Russian collusion by the Trump campaign is widely believed or known to be a fake paid for by the Clinton Foundation. Russia, since the early 1900's, has adopted a policy of maskirovka(masking), or Russian military deception. This includes camouflage, denial, and deception. ""Deceptive measures include concealment, imitation with decoys and dummies, manoeuvres intended to deceive, denial, and disinformation."" In other words, Russia is happy to take your money for any information you want as long as it isn't the truth. One wonders if our illustrious intelligence services know this? Comey? Mueller? Were they acting in good faith? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_military_deception

""Fruit of the poisonous tree is a legal metaphor in the United States used to describe evidence that is obtained illegally. The logic of the terminology is that if the source (the ""tree"") of the evidence or evidence itself is tainted, then anything gained (the ""fruit"") from it is tainted as well. ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_of_the_poisonous_tree In other words, all investigations and evidence that are result of the alleged, fraudulent dossier should be excluded from evidence in court. All convictions stemming from said evidence and investigations should be dismissed or overturned. This includes Trump himself and all the people around him that were investigated in connection to Russian collusion.

I'm an SF resident and read the PolitiFacts article last night regarding a meme floating around showing a mansion, being used to critique Pelosi's anti-wall stance. Essentially saying ""Why do you live in a walled community if walls are immoral?"". Everyone here knows Pelosi lived in the only walled community in SF for many years. Its in their marketing, its in her books, and its part of SF lore for most. The place was even originally built for whites to keep minorities out. So I decided to comment that they were correct the specific SF mansion shown was not hers, but she did in fact live in a walled community right down the street and it was a bit extreme to label the meme with their most falsifying qualifier. I saw the article using semantics to narrate their claims unjustly, and gave them the benefit of the doubt at first. That was until I was dismissed.

Would I choose arguing about Pelosi once living in a walled community as my hill to die on? Hell no. Its stupid and Americans should live where they choose, walls or not. I only share this so you guys can see as I did, there was ZERO research in this article, and the content of which becomes more and more based on nothing or hearsay, maybe because their sources were a facebook post and fly-by-night news website. This is supposed to be a bipartisan fact-checking site, and they dismiss me with 'my sources say'. Data talks. I didn't save a copy of the article last night, but if anyone has a way to access a cached version somehow, I'd be curious to see if they silently changed the article. It seems smaller but this is pure speculation on my part.

[Here is a link to the last AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/6iwc2l/i_was_a_senior_staff_member_on_a_winning_gop_us/)

We are very greatful to NSS for volunteering their time, effort, and experience. And so you know, NSS has staffed for several politicians that many on this sub support and hold in extremely high regard. (No, it's not Kasich) and don't play guessing games. If the identity of any of the politicians NSS has worked for come to light, the game is over and NSS can't answer as straightforward as they'd like. And believe me it is figuratively killing me not being able to tell you who that is so please don't make it worse. If you have ever wondered what it's like to play in the big leagues of politics, now is your chance to find out.

One final note:

We would like to extend our hand to other republican leaning subs to come take a gander and participate. We don't mind people advertising this but we do ask that you not post this on sub that are in direct opposition to republican values or view republicans in a negative light. Such actions will be viewed as attempting to brigade the AMA. When in doubt, please ask us mods first.

I made a second video apologizing for using divisive rhetoric in the first which went over even worse.  

The leftists mostly ignored the fundamental arguments of my videos and instead attacked me on my personal appearance, told me I’m a waste of time, called me a psychopath, and, I hate to admit it, but some of it got under my skin. 

I really just want to bring people together to protect my state from globalist agenda but the response I got was so negative that I feel pretty discouraged right now.  I’m still going to keep fighting for what I believe in and pushing out content even if I continue to get called a loser by my own people.

The Trump administration has offered a proposed rule that, if implemented, would make it less likely for foreign citizens who access welfare to receive a green card.

The proposed rule is published and open for public comment. So far, open-borders advocates have flooded the federal register with their comments in opposition to the proposal. Please leave your comment by clicking here:

[https://www.regulations.gov/comment?D=USCIS-2010-0012-0001](https://www.regulations.gov/comment?D=USCIS-2010-0012-0001)

Here are some suggested talking points you can include in your comment:

* **Express support for the public charge rule!**
* Welfare use among immigrant households is already high. A recent report from the Center for Immigration Studies found that 63% of non-citizen households, approximately 4.6 million, use welfare.
* The Migration Policy Institute confirms this finding. According to its research, 47.2% of non-citizens receive at least one type of the four major public benefits -- cash assistance, SSI, food stamps, and Medicaid/CHIP.
* The average immigrant household costs U.S. taxpayers $6,234 each year in federal welfare benefits.

**ABOUT THE 'PUBLIC CHARGE' RULE**

The administration's proposed rule simply strengthens the already existing rule that defines what welfare programs USCIS can consider in determining if a green card applicant is likely to become a public charge.

The existing rule is limited to cash assistance and institutionalization for long-term care. The [proposed rule](http://hub.numbersusa.com/route/8/5c0579bf74e18a7c11ae6e81/1721505/9?D=USCIS-2010-0012-0001) would include food stamps, public housing, and Medicaid, among other programs.

New analysis of government data from the Center for Immigration Studies finds that 63% of non-citizen headed households access some form of welfare. You can read more about their findings by [clicking here](http://hub.numbersusa.com/route/9/5c0579bf74e18a7c11ae6e81/1721505/9).

>France Faces a Typical Facebook Revolution

...

>The emerging pattern – leaderless protest networks developing on U.S.-owned platforms; meme-like narratives fueling popular indignation; nebulous, quickly radicalizing, demands fueled by lots of underlying anger – led Russian President Vladimir Putin to suspect the U.S. of organizing action in different parts of the world according to the same playbook.

...

>It’s happening again in France, a country impossible to describe as an autocracy and one where the U.S. has no reason to foment a revolution.

Elementary should be somewhere where a student should find their talent, not go to school and get piles of hw or don’t really find their talent. Where elementary should be like that. Furthermore if middle schools and high schools were joined to be just one public gov funded Academic school focused on subjects that the student is interested in. 

For example a academy made for writers or any academy made for students who enjoy math like a Academic Academy for Mathematics and Logic, which these academies will be more focused on a specific subject instead of multiple subjects students won’t use in their adult lives. So if anyone had any thought negative or positive I’m all ears

Republican,SDSU offering a course on impeaching trump.,"I’m a 3rd year at San Diego State University studying aerospace engineering. This is my first post in this subreddit and I couldn’t be more embarrassed that my school offers a course on impeaching Donald Trump. Apparently this is the second semester in a row they’re offering the course and just to give you a better idea of what the class is about, this is what the class details say: 

San Diego State University is offering a one-unit course in March called “Trump: Impeachment, Removal or Conviction?” taught by Professor John Joseph Cleary.

“Focus will be on the two constitutional grounds: impeachment and removal (25th Amendment), and the possible charges of the independent counsel,” the course description reads in part.

The class will cover “grounds for impeachment, removal, or indictment” such as “conflict of interests, foreign emoluments, climate change, racism, religious bias, improper influence, nepotism, and a host of crimes, including conspiracy, false statements, and obstruction of justice”

I’m actually at a loss for words, I don’t know how a college institution, let alone SDSU, would back such a painstakingly obvious biased class. I am very disappointed in my college for allowing lies and false accusations to be spread in a legitimate class. I have always been scared of teachers exerting their political opinions on kids without them realizing they’re being influenced, but for a “teacher” to be suggesting and teaching that Donald Trump should be impeached without any evidence or fair representation of both sides is ludicrous and dangerous for young adults who are supposed to be forming their own beliefs at this stage in their lives. Especially when it’s being offered as curriculum. I just feel bad for all the sheep getting brainwashed at this school, yet I get so angry because of them. Half of the students aren’t adept enough to do their own research and form their own opinion. Instead they opt for the force feeding of pure bullshit, compliments of the left.  Is it so hard to ask for people to just WAKE UP and start paying attention to what is actually going on around them. Sorry for the rambling and kind of jumping around from point to point. Just thoroughly disappointed in the growing gap between these two “political parties” and the deceit fueling the separation. "

If the politicians want to stall the bill from passing or outright vote to not pass such a bill, then not having the aid money is only their fault to blame. When the homeless ask about where is the aid, the politicians could then say to them that they would rather not have control burns,and proper land management."

Republican,Need to move out of North Jersey/NYC? Progressive conservative cities?,"Hello fellow republicans, 

My girlfriend and I, can NO longer take the uncivilized ways of liberalism. I grew up in Brooklyn and New Jersey when it was still an american place to live. We enjoyed the diners, the plentiful jobs and remember a time when a commoner would still speak English. Everything is different today. Slowly and slowly all the old native New Yorkers have left. Our towns today are runned down due to rapid immigration, ghetto thugs moving in and quite frankly they have no manners. The property taxes are off the charts due to many illegals sending their kids to school here- and of course we have to foot the tax bill. The politicians here don’t care either, they just want to fill their pockets. Plus if you’re white male here- and a conservative- then you get a sense of feeling you don’t belong. Alienation is very apparent. There are very few whites left in NJ at this point. At my work in nyc where more and more ppl are moving from California/San Francisco- things are changing  on daily basis. There is a clear divide where I work.  Many of my co-workers have left due to disrespectful new millennials..we are considering moving out to another state. I was wondering if you guys could comment about another city which might be comparative to living standards in north jersey/nyc. Pay cut is fine, at this point we just need a nice homely city/suburb- where people are polite, jobs are abundant, and starting a new family is feasible. Even swing cities and states would work. We are middle class educated conservatives- not extremely religious either- funny thing is we used to Democrats.

Thanks for reading. 

PS. In past 5 years- NY,NJ and CT had the highest net out migration. It has been happening before Trump got in power. "
