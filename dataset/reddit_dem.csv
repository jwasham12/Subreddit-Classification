They're gonna have to choose whether to stand against the flaws of modern capitalism, or continue to participate actively in a destructive system while bringing less worse out of it than republicans. 
Choose between supporting real democracy (more referendums, direct elections, transparency), or continuing to profit from the electoral system. (It's undeniable that the democrats (just as the Republicans) both profit from the fact that the electoral college makes it impossible for other parties to thrive. 
Democrats are also gonna have to choose between real ecological change, that require massive public investment, as AOC wants, or trust the ""free market"" and individual behavioral change in solving these issues.

If Democrats don't do that, they will not be able to conquer power in the next elections. Democrats need to conquer the ""people"", the working class that voted for Trump because Hillary's program was not social enough. We can do it, but we need to change"

I'm a libertarian, and I fundamentally disagree with both the democrats and the republicans on most things, but I consider myself a reasonable person and when forced, will pick the lesser of two evils, which is usually the dems when it comes to political issues...sans one thing, gun control.

The 2nd Amendment states:

A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, ***shall not be infringed***.

For me, that's very clear. That said, I understand some folks disagree and think we need gun control reform/laws.

My question is simple - as democrats, are you aware how much you alienate the ""center"" or ""middle"" when gun control is put on the table?

Again, I'm not trying to troll or inflame, but am genuinely curious if the average democrat understands that there are many folks who might LOATH trump, like myself, and yet who feel like they will be FORCED to vote for him, because if they don't a democratic president might get elected who will support stuff like Feinstein's recent gun control legislation: https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=press-releases&id=EFC76859-879D-4038-97DD-C577212ED17B


I suppose what I'm trying to say is this: I hate Trump, and I want a a better option, but come 2020 I feel I'll have no choice but to either vote 3rd party or republican because the democrats won't leave guns alone. I believe the 2nd amendment gives all of us the right to own any/all firearms that we feel are necessary to stand up against a tyrannical government, which is what the founders intended.

We put all this effort into energizing the people who went out there got registered, cast their ballot and made their voices heard. And it worked, Clinton won the popular vote by over 10%.

Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like we tell people it's as simple as just going out and voting. And that the majority will win. But isn't that just a fairytale we tell ourselves to make us feel more democratic?

The problem arises when you have your pre existing giant business with your rich owners. Bill Gates earned 11.5 billion in 2017. If he pays 70% to the government, people are getting fired.

Rich people own the place you work for (unless you are a federal employee). If your boss suddenly has to give 70% to the government, people are not going to have jobs.

This is how it works. All states are allowed to distribute their electoral votes as they see fit. The states that have signed the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (Maryland, New Jersey, Illinois, Hawaii, Washington, Massachusetts, District of Columbia, Vermont, California, Rhode Island, New York, and Connecticut) have decided to allocate their electoral votes based on what the National result is rather than the results of their own state. The best part is that it is not necessary that all states sign this, only enough states to allow a majority of electors. Right now the states that have signed the agreement make up 172 electors out of the 270 required to form a majority. If you do not live in one of the states listed above, please write to your state legislators to make sure this is pushed through!"

&#x200B;

Spring 2018 saw more than 50,000 teachers go on strike in the country's most conservative states (Oklahoma, West Virginia, Arizona). They won significant pay raises as well as more funding for schools. 2018 was a banner year for union organizing. Workers in steel plants, on farms, flipping burgers, and more organized and made gains, and very very very little of it had anything to do with Donald Trump. And we hardly read about this stuff - especially smaller strikes and successful contract negotiations - in the mainstream press.

&#x200B;

It is very very very important that we know about and acknowledge these victories. It is also vital that we see this as a struggle that is much bigger than the small man that is Donald Trump. Feel free to share

Many Democrats were opposed to the war and opposition seems to have grown overtime. Since Trump was an early critic of the War it seems that the Republican Party has now on the whole viewed the war as the wrong decision.

If you want to know why I support the war I will detail it for you here. By the time the Gulf War of 1990 was over Saddam Hussein had effectively suspended Iraq's sovereignty and made it an urgent issue of the international community against him by committing genocide, using WMDs, pursuing nuclear weapons, and repeatedly invading other countries. A violation of any of those is grounds for regime change and the continued violation of all of those justified and required the US and other countries to act against him in 1990. By 2003 he had continued to ignore the international community by attempting to build nuclear weapons and hiding them from international inspectors. He was also the most evil leader in the world and was unmatched in cruelty and ruthlessness. If you need an example of the wickedness that he engineered I recommend watching the video of the moment he sized power in 1979 where a forced confession against the Ba'ath Party was revealed infront of the party meeting where ""co-conspirators"" (perceived political threats to Hussein) were named and dragged out the room. After half the party members were dragged out of the room, the other half were given guns and told to execute the other half. This is the evil that had to be dealt with in Iraq and I am glad it was done away with.

democrats,Trump Accused of Hitting 'New Low' After Blaming Deaths of Migrant Children on Democrats,
democrats,"The only person Trump should fear in 2019, beside the Dems in the congress, is Robert Mueller. Even Trump's billion dollars legal team is expecting a very scathing report from Mr. Mueller outlining his collusion with the Russians to win his election in 2016 and then lying about it.","Although Trump knew that colluding with a foreign country is not a crime but what he didn't know then that ""obstruction of justice"" is a big crime in the eyes of the prosecutors.

And lying about collusion with a foreign country is also a crime which Trump did many times. 

Our prosecutors know that Trump lied at least 3,000 times in 2 years saying ""I did not collude with the Russians.""

That is the main reason why Trump should really be worried now thinking what the Special Counsel is writing in his report to be presented to the authorities, which means the Democrats in the upcoming congress and the Republicans in the Senate.

That tells us why Trump is not going too far from the White House at present.

Going to Iraq and Germany in the AF1 on the Christmas Day and going to the Naval Observatory to have dinner with his VP Mike Pence and his family was too easy of an outing than going to his estate in Mar-a-Lago where he could easily be arrested by the U.S. Marshall Servicemen with a warrant issued by a judge at Mr. Mueller's insistence.

If we analyze what kind of thought process is going on in Trump's mind then we can know why he is trying to project himself as a victim in this govt. shutdown time.

No wonder he's blaming the Democrats now for this shutdown fiasco which is his own making. He's even blaming the Democrats for the deaths of 2 migrant children while it was his idea mainly to  demand a damn wall on our southern border.

I know a lot of Americans will not believe this but to me and many other Democrats, the only person that Trump is really afraid of right now, is Robert Mueller.

Why ?

Because of the axiom : Guilty are afraid.

We may not know it but Trump knows in his heart of hearts that he's guilty like hell for colluding with the Russians to win his election in 2016.

Our 'illegitimate' president Trump also knows by now that the Special Counsel has come to know that truth in his two years' of Russia Investigation. 

Trump is more than 100% sure that prosecutors in the the Special Counsel's office have figured out with conclusive evidence that Trump did make arrangements with Putin on a pay-per-play scheme to accept the help that the Russian president was offering : That is to make Trump win the presidential election.

Trump may or may not know it but Mr. Mueller most probably knows that the pact that Trump made with Putin was that his campaign would take the Russian help in extracting emails from Hillary campaign's computers.

And when it's all over, Trump would lift all the sanctions that were placed on the Russian govt by various presidents in the past and also the sanctions approved by our Senate and the House in bilateral fashions over the years.

That is why I've no doubt in my mind that the Special Counsel holds the key to Trump's downfall or his continuing to rule a vast and complex country like ours for two more years in a tamed and contained atmosphere as Ross Douthat wrote in his Op-Ed in today's NYT titled""Will Trump in 2019 Be Untamed Or Contained ?""
 
Ross made his point more clear in the next sentence where he wrote, "" The political scenarios for another strange Trumpian year.""

Although it seems like an Utopian dream that Trump can be contained, especially by the Democrats of the House but somewhere along the line it's not impossible.

But with Mr. Mueller's complete report ready to hit our nation like a ton of bricks what else Trump and the Republicans do to avoid their party's meltdown in the next election in 2020 . Nothing .

Mr. Mueller, who's totally restrained in his appearance, is not giving an iota of hints about what is inside his report.

But many of us on the left know that the Special Counsel will hand over a bombshell to the congress around next week. 

As many legal experts have opined that the Special Counsel can bypass his acting AG Mathew Whitaker and even his immediate boss Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein and hand over his report directly to the House Judiciary Committee to be headed by Dem Congressman Adam Schiff, we can presume that Mr. Mueller will do just that.

And once he does that it'll be a scramble for all of us on the left as well as for the rest of the country to swoon over each and every lines of the Mueller Commission's report and ask for Trump's removal from office either through impeachment .

Or by forcing his crooked Republican party members to ask for their president's resignation just like what they did with Nixon in 1974. 

We know that the Republicans will be reluctant to ask Trump to resign but will be forced to do so if the Muller commission's report contains any audio evidence where they could hear Trump's voice asking the Russians for help personally to make him win the presidential election.

We the Democrats know for sure that this is how Trump became a president without any talents whatsoever.

So while it is everyone's guess what'll be inside Mr. Mueller's report, my guess is, Mr. Mueller's report will say Trump obstructed justice at least 34 times.

My gut instinct also says that there will be a very damaging 'obstruction of justice' case in that report. 

Yes, it's my strong belief that Mr. Mueller's report will say that Trump received at least four phone calls from his son Don Jr. who dialed a private number to inform his dad about what was going on in the infamous Trump Tower meeting on June 9,2016.

Trump lied and perjured himself in his answer to Mr. Mueller's questions by writing  ""NO"" to the prosecution team's question of whether he had any prior knowledge about the meeting with the Russian oligarchs and a Russian lawyer and his core campaign team members.

His son Don Jr, Rick Gates, Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen told the Special Prosecutors and the Senate Intelligence Committee, ""Yes, Mr. Trump knew everything about that meeting from the beginning till the end.""

Trump committed another 'Obstruction of justice' when he told the reporters on Air Force one, ""I wrote the letter of invitation for the meeting in the Trump Tower myself . Not my son."" just to shield his son Don Jr. from double jeopardy.

Go figure, why Trump is hiding in the White House right now ? 

Because he knows he's guilty as hell."

And many other things, it would only require 25% or so of republicans to vote for the amendments With the recent unanimous vote to re-open government in the senate, its an ideal time for democrats and Pelosi to leverage their unprecedented bargaining power - right now. If they dont act while Trump is at his weakest, the opportunity to reign in future presidents and supreme court justices may be gone for decades or centuries. Even if the amendments are not ratified by enough states at first, the states will always have the opportunity going into the future.
"
democrats,"Trump has got exactly 6 days to enjoy before his presidency will be in serious trouble. With Mueller's damning report about to be handed to the Dems in the House, Trump should think more about closing his own door than closing the border with Mexico.","With 50+ subpoenas already sent to the White House by Democrat Elijah Cummings, the Chair-Elect of the House Oversight Committee, Trump should be more concerned about how he'll wriggle himself out of this riddle of staying out of jail for possible collusion with Russia than closing the border with Mexico for lack of $5 billion from U.S. taxpayers that he always said in his campaign, "" Mexico will pay for it."" 

We also heard him saying something like this in all his campaigns, "" Yes, as your president, I'll force Mexican govt. to pay for that damn wall, be sure about that.""

And now with neither the congress nor Mexico is ready to pay him the money for the wall, part of which may end up in his campaign coffers, Trump is hellbent on demanding the same money again and again from the leaders of the Democratic party in Congress.

That is exactly what Annie Karni and Nicholas Fandos wrote in their Op-Ed in NYT today titled, ""Trump Threatens to Close Border If Congress Won't Fund Wall.""

Adding my own views to their reporting, I've to say that either Trump doesn't remember or he has no intention to believe that the two Dem leaders, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi told him pointblank in the White House two weeks back that they'd not pay any money for the wall but only for the border security personnel.

To which, we all remember hearing Trump making the following pledges on national tv, ""I'll then shut down the govt. And I'll take the blame for it. Be sure that I'll not put the blame on you two.""

So now with our government remaining in a shutdown mode, Trump is one step away from turning this country into one of those third world countries where the government hardly functions.

On the contrary, if he really wants this country to function like the way it used to function before he came into power, he should stop thinking about how to win his next election.

Yes, I strongly believe that Trump should start mitigating the pains of the federal workers who'd been furloughed for no fault of their own last week in the latest closure of all the non-emergency government agencies.

And if he thinks that his first two years of office was a cakewalk, Trump should compare the next two years of his presidency with walking on fire.

With Mr. Mueller's report about to hit the capitol with the loudest noises we've ever heard in our lifetime, Trump will be lucky to finish the first month of the next year as a president before the Republicans in congress force him to resign just like what they did with Nixon in 1974."

Knowing that Mr. Mueller is going to hand over his report to the Dem led House on Jan 3,2019, the G.O.P. has to remove a very toxic Trump before the Impeachment trial starts.","Yes, it's really a ""truth or dare"" situation for the Republicans to confront their president Trump.

The G.O.P. leaders in the House and especially in the Senate have to deal with Trump's treachery right now than any time later.

With the congressional and senatorial elections hurtling down towards 32+ Republican Senators on Nov 3rd, 2020, it'll be totally foolish on the part of Mitch McConnell and his G.O.P. cohorts to ignore Trump's blatant lies and his total deceptive tactics to thwart a genuine Russian meddling investigation since the day he took the office.

Mr. Mueller doesn't have to say this that Trump took the help from Russian hackers to win his one and only election of his lifetime in 2016.

The Republican leaders and their members in the congress should have enough intelligence to know that Russia did intervene in our elections in 2016 to make Trump win against his opponent Hillary.

In fact many of those Republican congress members knew first hand about how toxic Trump was for their campaigns that they didn't invite their president for their campaign rallies.

Many of those G.O.P. House members lost their elections on Nov. 6th this year. But in their hearts and in their minds they're still convinced that it was the right thing to do : Not to stand next to their toxic president.

But the real challenge for the Republican congressional election campaign committee will come right now before the year ends.

With Robert Mueller's report about to be handed over to the new House of Representatives to be led by the Democrats on Jan 3rd next year, it is just a matter of few chaotic days in the Capitol in Washington that'll decide the fate of Trump and the Republicans in 2020's presidential and congressional elections.

And ""even if his investigation is cut short"" as Elizabeth Drew wrote in her nicely written Op-Ed in today's NYT titled ""The Inevitability of Impeachment"", Robert Mueller holds the key to Trump's impeachment in his own hand.

""Whether or not there's already enough evidence to impeach Mr. Trump.....we will learn what the Special Counsel has found"" as Ms. Drew wrote in her piece, the Republicans should presume that Mr. Mueller has found a lot of evidence to throw Trump's presidency ""under the bus.""

But on the other hand if the G.O.P. House and Senate members do nothing after interrogating Trump in the White House, then they'll be taking the largest bet in the world.

Knowing what we know about Trump who as per Washington Post who created a special category for Trump beside the category of 'Pants On Fire', has lied more than 7,689 times in 2 years, the Republicans will not only lose the White House, the House and the Senate but they'll lose all the governors' elections and the state Senate and Assembly elections wherever their candidates will be competing against Democrats in 2020."

democrats,Trump is a fool to think that all the military personnel will forgive him for what he did to our 4 Star Marine General Jim Mattis. Going to Iraq yesterday and greeting 100+ Air Force members in a base in Iraq will not take away our disgust for a leader who has no respect for our military leaders .,"Yes, no matter how many times Trump visits our troops in Iraq or in Syria or in Afghanistan, he cannot erase the fact that the majority of our brothers and sisters in military hate him for the way he treated one of our own favorites Jim Mattis, who earned the nickname ""Mad Dog"" for a reason.

Although I've to admit that his trip to Iraq yesterday was a welcome change from his earlier disrespects to our military like when he didn't attend the ceremony to honor our WWI war heroes in France.

And also the period when he'd shown total neglect of his duties to honor our soldiers on the Veteran's Day.

But what Trump doesn't realize is that by forcing his current Defense Secretary to resign by using a tweet obout his desire to  withdraw from Syria immediately, Trump has touched a raw nerve of all the military personnel of this country and around the world.

And by appointing someone like Mr. Shanahan as a replacement for Gen. Mattis, Trump has inflicted tremendous pain to the morale of our brave men and women in uniforms after they came to know that their fake Commander-in-Chief has cut short the date of his Defense Secretary's end of his long service to the nation by two months just because Trump failed to read Mr. Mattis' resignation letter thinking it was his Defense Secretary's retirement letter.


A real stupid Trump never bothered to find out from the letter that Mr. Mattis wrote in it about his desire to stay in his job in the Pentagon until the end of February so that he could attend a special Session or the anual meeting of NATO where all the defense ministers of all the countries under North Atlantic Treaty Organization want to discuss in length about the threats to their nations from rogue countries like Russia and China, Iran, Venezuela et Al.

But now with Mr. Mattis' premature departure on Dec 31st of this year, ""Who's going to protect our country from Russia and China and other rogue nations ?""

Not Patrick M. Shanahan, for sure."

democrats,"After pissing off all our military personnel and all our 401(k) investors after 3+ trillion dollars were wiped off from the stock market, Trump is scared to leave the White House. His demand for that stupid ""border wall"" will force his presidency to crash pretty soon.","By shutting down our govt while demanding $5 billion for a stupid ""border wall"", Trump has brought our country almost to a standstill.  

The same view was expressed by Katie Rogers and Emily Cochrane, in their Op-Ed in today's NYT titled 'Trump's Christmas Message : ""It's a Disgrace What's Happening"" while they wrote about how Trump deliberately crashed the stock market by shutting down the govt only because the Democrats refused to give him the funding for the same wall or ""steel slats"" or ""fences"" as he calls them now.

After living his life through as a young man just like all of us did in the '60s while he witnessed the assassination of president Kennedy on tv on Nov 22, 1963 by some unsavory characters from M.I.C., Trump is petrified to leave the White House now after pissing off the entire military by forcing ""Mad Mag"" Mattis to resign over troops withdrawal from Syria.

As we came to know later on that Trump tweeted about troops withdrawal from Syria after he probably got a very disturbing call from Russia's Putin threatening the Russian puppet in the White House with dire consequences.

It is widely presumed that Putin blackmailed Trump 
with a sex tape in his possession about an ordeal in a Moscow hotel which as per the ""Steel dossier"" is a very genuine tape indeed.

Lot of Americans like me strongly believe that Russia's counter-intelligence officers recorded Trump frolicking with at least 6 Russian prostitutes in a Moscow hotel suite where president Obama stayed with his wife Michelle a few years back before Trump arrived in Moscow for a Miss Universe contest. 

No wonder the threat of the ""pee tape"" coming out in the open played a key role when Trump ordered the withdrawal of 2,000 U.S. soldiers from Syria and 7,000 of our brave men and women from Afghanistan immediately, as the rumor goes. 

Maybe a soon to be impeached Trump should reinforce his 45th Floor office in Trump Tower with anti-tank shell proof windows after his forced retirement from presidency on or after Jan 3, 2019.

We know that our new Dem House members are getting goosebumps thinking about their sudden gained power to impeach a sitting president.

No wonder Trump was holed up in the White House for the holidays instead of spending the Christmas at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida with other members of his family, giving away a 7+ century old secret to a 7-year old boy insinuating ""There is no Santa Clause.""

And if the shutdown of our government continues for few more days Trump will find himself in a dire situation that he never faced in his life : Lonely like a dog in a shelter.

Blaming the Democrats will not bring the money for the wall as Mitch McConnell will not use the ""nuclear options"" to get 51 votes to reopen the government before Jan 3rd next year when the Democrats will control the House.

I'm pretty sure that Trump can bet that the 240 Democratic House members will introduce a new budget without any funding for the wall and force the republican controlled Senate at their peril to start a trend of passing future budgets with 51 votes.

The Senate majority leader knows that when the Dem Senators under Chuck Schumer will control the Senate in 2021, they'll pass everything including the budgets with a bare minimum number of 51 Votes which never happened in our Senate in the Capitol in Washington in the 242+ years of long history of this country."

Instead we should expect for the certain fall of our great Republic that was built more than 200 years before we were born.

No wonder Thomas L. Friedman wrote about the same outcome in his Op-Ed in today's NYT titled ""Time for G.O.P. to Threaten to fire Trump""

Thomas also quoted James Comey's suggestion that ""instead of impeaching Trump we should vote him out in the ballot box in 2020"".

But the next line that Mr. Friedman wrote in his piece, ""Republican leaders need to mount an intervention"" says a lot about his views which is similar to my views and many like minded Americans like me.

Although Mr. Comey's suggestion sounds so good when we hear it but the problem for all the true Americans is, ""Should we allow Trump to ruin our lives and the reputation of our country for two more years."" 

Or ""we should try to impeach him and then let the U.S. Marshall Service guys go to the White House to break open Trump's bedroom door and literally drag him out of his bedroom closet in his pajamas.""

The reason why I mentioned about using the U.S. Marshall service officers to do that dirty job of lifting our would be deposed president was because of the knowledge about Trump's mindset that we gained in two years of his presidency.

We know by now that Trump will not give up so easily even after U.S. Marshall service members show him the impeachment papers and the eviction notice signed by all the nine Justices of S.C.O.T.U.S.

With his strong ego that we noticed so far, this Russia friendly president called Trump will not walk out or board the U.S. Navy helicopter which will wait for him in the White House lawn to give him a farewell ride like it gave one to Nixon on August 9,1974.  

A morally hurt and emotionally wounded and weighing almost 230 pounds, Trump will fight back and not walk out of the White House so easily, that's for sure.

That's why we can hope that our Secret Service members will step back after verifying nine Supreme Court Justices' signatures and allow U.S. Marshall service members do their job for which they're thoroughly trained ."
