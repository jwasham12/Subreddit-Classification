democrats,"Once again, Democrats have to clean up the GOP's mess.",
democrats,"If the Republicans want to win anything in 2020, they've to confront Trump right now about his Russian collusion. Knowing that Mr. Mueller is going to hand over his report to the Dem led House on Jan 3,2019, the G.O.P. has to remove a very toxic Trump before the Impeachment trial starts.","Yes, it's really a ""truth or dare"" situation for the Republicans to confront their president Trump.

The G.O.P. leaders in the House and especially in the Senate have to deal with Trump's treachery right now than any time later.

With the congressional and senatorial elections hurtling down towards 32+ Republican Senators on Nov 3rd, 2020, it'll be totally foolish on the part of Mitch McConnell and his G.O.P. cohorts to ignore Trump's blatant lies and his total deceptive tactics to thwart a genuine Russian meddling investigation since the day he took the office.

Mr. Mueller doesn't have to say this that Trump took the help from Russian hackers to win his one and only election of his lifetime in 2016.

The Republican leaders and their members in the congress should have enough intelligence to know that Russia did intervene in our elections in 2016 to make Trump win against his opponent Hillary.

In fact many of those Republican congress members knew first hand about how toxic Trump was for their campaigns that they didn't invite their president for their campaign rallies.

Many of those G.O.P. House members lost their elections on Nov. 6th this year. But in their hearts and in their minds they're still convinced that it was the right thing to do : Not to stand next to their toxic president.

But the real challenge for the Republican congressional election campaign committee will come right now before the year ends.

With Robert Mueller's report about to be handed over to the new House of Representatives to be led by the Democrats on Jan 3rd next year, it is just a matter of few chaotic days in the Capitol in Washington that'll decide the fate of Trump and the Republicans in 2020's presidential and congressional elections.

And ""even if his investigation is cut short"" as Elizabeth Drew wrote in her nicely written Op-Ed in today's NYT titled ""The Inevitability of Impeachment"", Robert Mueller holds the key to Trump's impeachment in his own hand.

""Whether or not there's already enough evidence to impeach Mr. Trump.....we will learn what the Special Counsel has found"" as Ms. Drew wrote in her piece, the Republicans should presume that Mr. Mueller has found a lot of evidence to throw Trump's presidency ""under the bus.""

But on the other hand if the G.O.P. House and Senate members do nothing after interrogating Trump in the White House, then they'll be taking the largest bet in the world.

Knowing what we know about Trump who as per Washington Post who created a special category for Trump beside the category of 'Pants On Fire', has lied more than 7,689 times in 2 years, the Republicans will not only lose the White House, the House and the Senate but they'll lose all the governors' elections and the state Senate and Assembly elections wherever their candidates will be competing against Democrats in 2020."

democrats,More Footage from Trump Speech In Iraq (Not shown in Mainstream Media!),
democrats,Trump is a fool to think that all the military personnel will forgive him for what he did to our 4 Star Marine General Jim Mattis. Going to Iraq yesterday and greeting 100+ Air Force members in a base in Iraq will not take away our disgust for a leader who has no respect for our military leaders .,"Yes, no matter how many times Trump visits our troops in Iraq or in Syria or in Afghanistan, he cannot erase the fact that the majority of our brothers and sisters in military hate him for the way he treated one of our own favorites Jim Mattis, who earned the nickname ""Mad Dog"" for a reason.

Although I've to admit that his trip to Iraq yesterday was a welcome change from his earlier disrespects to our military like when he didn't attend the ceremony to honor our WWI war heroes in France.

And also the period when he'd shown total neglect of his duties to honor our soldiers on the Veteran's Day.

But what Trump doesn't realize is that by forcing his current Defense Secretary to resign by using a tweet obout his desire to  withdraw from Syria immediately, Trump has touched a raw nerve of all the military personnel of this country and around the world.

And by appointing someone like Mr. Shanahan as a replacement for Gen. Mattis, Trump has inflicted tremendous pain to the morale of our brave men and women in uniforms after they came to know that their fake Commander-in-Chief has cut short the date of his Defense Secretary's end of his long service to the nation by two months just because Trump failed to read Mr. Mattis' resignation letter thinking it was his Defense Secretary's retirement letter.


A real stupid Trump never bothered to find out from the letter that Mr. Mattis wrote in it about his desire to stay in his job in the Pentagon until the end of February so that he could attend a special Session or the anual meeting of NATO where all the defense ministers of all the countries under North Atlantic Treaty Organization want to discuss in length about the threats to their nations from rogue countries like Russia and China, Iran, Venezuela et Al.

But now with Mr. Mattis' premature departure on Dec 31st of this year, ""Who's going to protect our country from Russia and China and other rogue nations ?""

Not Patrick M. Shanahan, for sure."

democrats,"After pissing off all our military personnel and all our 401(k) investors after 3+ trillion dollars were wiped off from the stock market, Trump is scared to leave the White House. His demand for that stupid ""border wall"" will force his presidency to crash pretty soon.","By shutting down our govt while demanding $5 billion for a stupid ""border wall"", Trump has brought our country almost to a standstill.  

The same view was expressed by Katie Rogers and Emily Cochrane, in their Op-Ed in today's NYT titled 'Trump's Christmas Message : ""It's a Disgrace What's Happening"" while they wrote about how Trump deliberately crashed the stock market by shutting down the govt only because the Democrats refused to give him the funding for the same wall or ""steel slats"" or ""fences"" as he calls them now.

After living his life through as a young man just like all of us did in the '60s while he witnessed the assassination of president Kennedy on tv on Nov 22, 1963 by some unsavory characters from M.I.C., Trump is petrified to leave the White House now after pissing off the entire military by forcing ""Mad Mag"" Mattis to resign over troops withdrawal from Syria.

As we came to know later on that Trump tweeted about troops withdrawal from Syria after he probably got a very disturbing call from Russia's Putin threatening the Russian puppet in the White House with dire consequences.

It is widely presumed that Putin blackmailed Trump 
with a sex tape in his possession about an ordeal in a Moscow hotel which as per the ""Steel dossier"" is a very genuine tape indeed.

Lot of Americans like me strongly believe that Russia's counter-intelligence officers recorded Trump frolicking with at least 6 Russian prostitutes in a Moscow hotel suite where president Obama stayed with his wife Michelle a few years back before Trump arrived in Moscow for a Miss Universe contest. 

No wonder the threat of the ""pee tape"" coming out in the open played a key role when Trump ordered the withdrawal of 2,000 U.S. soldiers from Syria and 7,000 of our brave men and women from Afghanistan immediately, as the rumor goes. 

Maybe a soon to be impeached Trump should reinforce his 45th Floor office in Trump Tower with anti-tank shell proof windows after his forced retirement from presidency on or after Jan 3, 2019.

We know that our new Dem House members are getting goosebumps thinking about their sudden gained power to impeach a sitting president.

No wonder Trump was holed up in the White House for the holidays instead of spending the Christmas at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida with other members of his family, giving away a 7+ century old secret to a 7-year old boy insinuating ""There is no Santa Clause.""

And if the shutdown of our government continues for few more days Trump will find himself in a dire situation that he never faced in his life : Lonely like a dog in a shelter.

Blaming the Democrats will not bring the money for the wall as Mitch McConnell will not use the ""nuclear options"" to get 51 votes to reopen the government before Jan 3rd next year when the Democrats will control the House.

I'm pretty sure that Trump can bet that the 240 Democratic House members will introduce a new budget without any funding for the wall and force the republican controlled Senate at their peril to start a trend of passing future budgets with 51 votes.

The Senate majority leader knows that when the Dem Senators under Chuck Schumer will control the Senate in 2021, they'll pass everything including the budgets with a bare minimum number of 51 Votes which never happened in our Senate in the Capitol in Washington in the 242+ years of long history of this country."

Instead we should expect for the certain fall of our great Republic that was built more than 200 years before we were born.

No wonder Thomas L. Friedman wrote about the same outcome in his Op-Ed in today's NYT titled ""Time for G.O.P. to Threaten to fire Trump""

Thomas also quoted James Comey's suggestion that ""instead of impeaching Trump we should vote him out in the ballot box in 2020"".

But the next line that Mr. Friedman wrote in his piece, ""Republican leaders need to mount an intervention"" says a lot about his views which is similar to my views and many like minded Americans like me.

Although Mr. Comey's suggestion sounds so good when we hear it but the problem for all the true Americans is, ""Should we allow Trump to ruin our lives and the reputation of our country for two more years."" 

Or ""we should try to impeach him and then let the U.S. Marshall Service guys go to the White House to break open Trump's bedroom door and literally drag him out of his bedroom closet in his pajamas.""

The reason why I mentioned about using the U.S. Marshall service officers to do that dirty job of lifting our would be deposed president was because of the knowledge about Trump's mindset that we gained in two years of his presidency.

We know by now that Trump will not give up so easily even after U.S. Marshall service members show him the impeachment papers and the eviction notice signed by all the nine Justices of S.C.O.T.U.S.

With his strong ego that we noticed so far, this Russia friendly president called Trump will not walk out or board the U.S. Navy helicopter which will wait for him in the White House lawn to give him a farewell ride like it gave one to Nixon on August 9,1974.  

A morally hurt and emotionally wounded and weighing almost 230 pounds, Trump will fight back and not walk out of the White House so easily, that's for sure.

That's why we can hope that our Secret Service members will step back after verifying nine Supreme Court Justices' signatures and allow U.S. Marshall service members do their job for which they're thoroughly trained ."

After tweeting that ""Mad Dog"" Gen. Mattis will be removed on Jan. 1st and not on Feb 28,2019 as the Defense Secretary wrote in his resignation letter because "" he had wanted to stay through a NATO defense ministers meeting scheduled for February"", as reported in today's NYT, Trump has shown his childish and very boorish behaviors .

Helene Cooper and Katie Rogers also told us through their Op-Ed that Trump got frustrated, over the constant positive news coverage of his courageous Defense Secretary, without even reading the letter Mr. Mattis wrote about why he resigned.

Relying on the comments made on Fox Tv has been a staple of Trump's presidential life throughout his two years of torturous  reign.

No wonder through the same medium Trump came to know that it was not an early retirement but a total denunciation of Trump's order of troops withdrawal from Syria which prompted Jim Mattis to resign his position as Defense Secretary at the end of February next year.

So firing Jim Mattis two months early just because he couldn't tolerate the glowing tributes pouring in from all the Defense experts as well as from the NATO leaders in foreign countries like Emanuel Macron of France, was too much to bear for our president with a second grader's brain .

He fired his second Defense Secretary in his 2 years of presidential reign with a tweet just like he fired many people in the past, especially his first Secretary of State Rex Tillerson earlier in 2017 with a tweet too.

But what Trump doesn't know is that the man he has chosen to replace Gen. Mattis with, Mr. Patrick M. Shanahan has more experience with a civilian job than any true knowledge of the complexity of our military excursions abroad like the Four-Star General Jim Mattis had acquired in his 49 years of service in the military.

Compared to Mr. Shanahan who only worked in Boeing from 1986 till 2017 before joining our Defense Dept, Gen. Mattis was a Supreme Allied Commander Transformation from November 9, 2007- September 8,2009 beside being a Commander of the United States Joint Forces Command from November 9, 2007 -August 1,2010 and Commander of United States Central Command from August 11,2010 till March 22,2013.

And unlike his presumed replacement, Gen. Mattis never wanted to harm or kill any civilians in foreign countries with lethal weapons.

But at the Defense Department last year, our Acting Defense Secretary Mr. Shanahan ""scuttled a pledge to destroy the military's existing stockpile of cluster munitions allowing the military to once again arm itself with a type of weapon banned by 102 countries"" as reported by the two Op-Ed writers in their piece.

Trump, the half-child and half-grown up who never had a mental capacity to govern even a small country like Timbuktu or Bora Bora, has now lost all the touches with the reality.

No doubt that he's thoroughly incapable to rule the most diverse and vast country like our America.

That's the reason why the Republicans in congress must act now than later to make an immediate arrangement to put Trump in a mental institution or maybe in the psyche ward of some major hospital under the ""Baker Act"" with the approval of his close family members .

And once they do that they should invoke the 25th Amendment of the constitution to install VP Mike Pence in the White House after nullifying Trump's presidency.

Because if they don't do this never tried before and a very complex act of replacing a sitting president with a vice president or the speaker of the house as its clearly explained in our Constitution under the 25th Amendment, then those Republicans will literally send our great country called U.S.A. towards total destruction by allowing a very destructive president to sit in the Oval Room of the White House for another two costly years.

Trump, who formulates his foreign policy after learning the tricks from his crooked advisers anchoring the Fox Tv, did about an U-turn last Thursday even after advising Sarah Sanders last Tuesday to announce to all the Senators and House members that her president would ""accept a  stopgap bill that did not include money for a border wall"" as reported by the editors of today's NYT titled, ""Shutdown ? More Like a Breakdown.""

It's really scary to think that right after one more day, that is Thursday, our Dotard president promptly reversed course.

Yes, it's hard to imagine that yesterday Trump went more crazy than Thursday. 

As per the same editorial Trump went totally belligerent and was completely berserk when he asked Mitch McConnell to use ""nuclear option"" to pass the budget with 51 Republican Senators' votes that also included $5 billion for a wall (or as he calls it,""steel slats"") after conservatives like Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh and his cheerleaders at Fox & Friends called him totally ""gutless"" .

democrats,"Trump should realize that he'll be the only inmate in Guantanamo Bay prison if our military ever takes over power. Forcing the only general in his administration to resign,Trump has hurt the feelings of all the military personnel of this country and beyond.","Although all our military personnel are trained to show their respects to their Commander-in-Chief but Trump has crossed all the lines of decency when he insulted his Defense Secretary General Jim Mattis by unilaterally withdrawing our troops from Syria by a tweet without bothering to consult the person in charge of protecting the lives of 1.3 million active-duty troops including the 2,000 soldiers who were ordered to come home very abruptly by Trump ""on Wednesday over the objections of his senior advisers"" as Helene Cooper reported in her Op-Ed today in NYT titled, ""Jim Mattis, Defense Secretary, Resigns in Rebuke of Trump's Worldview."" 

Although Secretary Mattis was quite aware for sometime that he too, like three other generals before him in the Trump Administration, has to leave after his Commander-In Chief insulted him on National tv saying, ""I think Jim Mattis is a Democrat"" as if our general's contribution to our country doesn't matter if he belonged to a political party which Trump hates from the bottom of his heart.

So now by putting General Mattis on the sidelines, Trump is acting solely on the basis of pleasing his die-hard rotten followers for whom our country's national interests or our national security doesn't matter, only their messiah's ego or his fake promises that he made before his election in 2016.

For that matter, we can deduce from this earth shattering announcement on Wednesday that Trump is beholden to Putin for some unknown reasons than his duty to uphold our country's interests first.

We can bet our money that it was Putin who told Trump to take our U.S. troops from Syria so that Russian and Assad's Syrian soldiers can kill the rest of the rebels that we supported for so long and take full control of the country for themselves.

And Trump like an obedient baby has decided not to piss Putin off but do whatever the Russian president tells him to do in case Putin hands over Trump's ""pee tape"" to one of our news media to embarrass the current U.S. President in front of the whole world.

That is the reason why Trump should hope that there is no terrible fallout from his irresponsible act of withdrawing our troops from Syria and Afghanistan without consulting his Defense Secretary General Jim Mattis first.

Trump should also hope that our rank and file members of the military will remain quite about this terrible insult to their leader of the military and go on with what they're always doing that is protecting our country from foreign enemies. "

Should we continue to be the so-called ""world's policemen"", at times carrying out (some) atrocities of our own in the name of not letting a potentially worse actor fill the voids we'd be leaving? ""Doing it for the greater good"", in other words. A bit Machiavellian if you ask me.

Should we be more principled and restrained in our approach, shifting an increasing amount of the military burden to our allies, particularly in the west?

democrats,"Trump will be too stupid not to hire a moving truck and leave the White House before the end of this year. There is no way his presidency can survive after Judge Sullivan told Mr. Flynn yesterday,""Tell the truth or go to the prison for a long time.""","After the courtroom drama yesterday,Trump has exactly 12 days to resign and move back to his Trump Tower permanently as a private citizen.

""No one is above the law"", the phrase that Paula Duncan, a Trump enthusiast juror used in the Manafort trial as the Editors of NYT  quoted in their editorial today titled, ""Trumpian Spin Had Its Day in Court"".

The same Editors' next sentence, ""Nothing but the truth, a judge tells Michael Flynn. Listening Mr. President ?"", goes to the very essence of the jurisprudence of this country that Trump doesn't understand or just ignores it.

I like many Americans on the left will be really surprised if we find Trump in the White House on Jan 1st 2019.

Other than Trump everyone in this world including a man living on the street knows when he or she'll be arrested for ""living on the street without a permit"".

But as we know that Trump, who falsely thinks he can wrestle anyone to the floor, like we saw him wresting down the owner of WWE Vince McMahon on the floor outside the main stage and shaving his head in a fake pay-per-view match in 2007, doesn't think so.

After March 18th,2019,when all three of his former henchmen/ associates including Michael Flynn beside Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen are sent to different federal prisons by three separate federal judges if they still didn't implicate Trump with Russian meddling in our elections, maybe Trump should start counting his stars and look for an exit door from the White House.

There is no way that that this clown from WrestleManias can wrestle Judge Emmet Sullivan down who chastised his first National Security Director Michael Flynn yesterday by saying these sentences in a hypothetical way, ""I want nothing but the truth in 90 days if you do not want to go to the prison. Your military records will mean nothing to me if you still try to shield your criminal president who sold our country to our worst enemy, Russia.""

Now, we can all recall that it was Mr. Flynn who started the chant, ""Lock Her Up"" in the R.N.C. Convention in 2016. 

But if he doesn't open his mouth in the next 3 months' time that he gained with a hidden promise to Judge Sullivan that ,""I'll tell Mr. Mueller everything I know about Trump team's collusion with Russia"", then only God help him, not Trump.

So if by any chance or with a promise of pardon from Trump, Mike Flynn doesn't reveal to the prosecutors everything he's keeping in his heart regarding Trump's collusion with Russia, it'll be him who'll be locked up in a federal prison on March 19th,next year, not Hillary.

Mr. Flynn should know that even if Trump pardons him after he's sentenced to a minimum of six months' of prison time by Judge Sullivan, Mr. Mueller can still send his case to the state of Virginia or to a court in Washington D.C. where Trump's pardon will have no meaning.

So with the knowledge that none of his pardons will work in the states of New York and Virginia for three of his close campaign aides who'll realize pretty soon that they've no other choices but to implicate their crime boss before they go to prisons sometime in the month of March next year, Trump will be too stupid to hang around in the White House watching the spring flowers bloom.

Maybe we the Dems should put up signs outside the White House right now that reads, ""Run Trump Run. That's the only choice you've right now.""

Or repeat the slogan we Democrats did for Nixon in 1974, ""HONK, if you think Trump is guilty."""

The man who used Russian nerds to spread fake news in 2016,now wants to shut down the govt on Friday only because he wants a big cut from the wall funding.","It seems quite obvious that as the days go by Trump is turning into a man who's as nasty as one can be.

It also seems like that the wisest fool in our country who grabbed the main power seat in our country that is the Presidency of the United States, is upto his old trick again : Using his sick hostage taking technique that he used before the election in 2016 saying something like, ""My supporters may turn violent act if I don't win the presidency"" as an Op-ed in today's NYT titled ,""Chaos ? A Trump Specialty"" by Michelle Cottle reported.

As a proof of that statement, we all heard him last week insinuating the same threats against our democracy again by saying something like,""If I'm ever impeached, my followers might turn into violent mobs.""

So no wonder that with each hour clicking towards a showdown or shutdown of the Government culminating on the midnight of Friday this week, it seems like Trump is challenging every Americans' guts by saying ""Stop me if you can."" Or ""If I don't get what I want, you people won't get nothing either.""

Or how about this as something that Trump will say maybe today or maybe tomorrow like ""You poor people can't even go to the national parks in the upcoming holidays as I'll close down the entire country if I don't get my money for the Wall from the Democrats in the congress.""

By playing to the sentiments of his power base, Trump is now on his nastiest act of shutting down the entire govt even after saying  all along in all his campaign stops, "" I'll force Mexico to pay for the Wall by stopping the Mexicans staying here to send any money to their country through our banks, Western Union and our post offices."" 

Although it's true that he hoodwinked all the pundits in 2016 by clinching the presidency by promising to clean the swamp in Washington but now we know thanks to ta very damning Senate Report that came out yesterday that Donald Trump betrayed the entire country by using the help of some nerds sitting in the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, Russia who just kept on feeding one fake news after another to the African-Americans, suburban White women et Al by spreading lies like ""Hillary Clinton was suffering from a serious illness.""

And ""Ms. Clinton approved weapons sales to the Islamic state as Secretary of State.""

And also this,""Donald Trump had been endorsed by Pope Francis"" as another Op-Ed in today's NYT by Michelle Goldberg reported with a suitable title for her piece saying,""Yes, Russian Trolls Helped Elect Trump.""

So it seems quite obvious that Trump, after clinching his victory in 2016 by some unsavory characters from Putin's Russia, really thinks he can do anything under the earth and get away with it if his hard core uneducated supporters give him total support.

No wonder Trump is so indignant now about the effects of a shutdown of the government for a cause that he himself forced his supporters to chant in all his rallies saying ,""Mexico is going to pay for this wall."" 

And when Mexico is about to bring the Chinese dragons on our doorstep if Trump kept on putting pressure on them for paying for the wall, Trump wants to make our federal workers suffer by telling the Democrats, ""Pay for the wall or else your union members will be furloughed.""

Go figure !"

**^(NOTES:)**

^(\*) ^(In accordance with Democratic Party history and tradition, nominees of the Jeffersonian ""Democratic"" Republican Party are listed for the elections of 1792 to 1824 and are numbered accordingly.)

^(a. While officially independent, President Washington was nominated by both the Federalist and Republican parties. The election of 1792 instead proved to be a contest for the office of Vice President with the Federalists nominating incumbent Vice President Adams, who went on to be reelected, and the Republicans nominating Governor Clinton.)

^(b. Though former Secretary of State Jefferson officially ran as his party's nominee for President, as the winner of the second highest number of electoral votes in 1796, he was elected Vice President as was then prescribed in the Constitution. This resulted with a President and a Vice President from opposing parties. Causing more issues for Jefferson in the 1800 election, this electoral process would go on to be reformed by the 12th Amendment.)

^(c. Since President Monroe and Vice President Tompkins ran for reelection in 1820 unopposed, the nominating caucus, while voting informally to nominate the ticket, decided there was no need to formalize the nomination.)

^(d. Initially nominated for Vice President by the congressional nominating caucus in 1824, former Secretary of the Treasury Gallatin later withdrew and was replaced by former Speaker of the House Macon. They were later defeated by other candidates from their party in the popular vote, the Electoral College vote, and in the contingent election in the House of Representatives.)

^(e. Vice President Johnson was not officially nominated for reelection in 1840, but was the de facto candidate in the election.)

^(f. Instead of running a separate ticket in the 1872 election, the Democratic National Convention chose to nominate the Liberal Republican ticket with the hopes of avoiding a divided electoral opposition to the Republican ticket.)

^(g. Initially nominated for Vice President by the 1972 Democratic National Convention, Senator Eagleton later withdrew and was replaced by former Ambassador Shriver.)"

Therefore why not printing the money it needs instead of asking for ridiculous loans or taxing citizens? Some people say that would create inflation. The question is, how much inflation if any at all? Would that inflation be dwarfed by the economic benefits of a tax-free society? Because I think what Congress is doing with its irresponsible lending is much worse than printing money instead of taxing. Of course, the printing of the money would need to be done in a judicious manner, with expert studies, instead of haphazardly injecting currency in the economy as Venezuela and Zimbabwe did."

However, following this year's midterms, it seems like a lot of people just let loose and I'm seeing a level of toxicity on social media (Twitter being the absolute worse, good God) that is giving me a lot of familiar feelings that makes me think we might not win the 2020 election and it's not even 2019 yet. I'm hoping that instead of waiting until the month prior to start shouting empty ""unity"" slogans, we can toss around some ideas on how to prevent it from getting to that point. I have a few ideas (or guidelines) that might help and I want to hear what you guys think as well. 

1. Talk about why your candidate is good, not why other candidates are bad

2. It is literally never helpful to disrespect supporters of a candidate, it's largely irrelevant to the candidate's platform and it only cements their support for their candidate. It doesn't make them want to listen to your ideas or perspective.

3. Whataboutism is a nonsense tactic. I'm assuming you're not a 5 year old and don't believe your toxic actions can be justified by something you saw someone else do on facebook. If it's wrong, it's wrong all the time no matter who does it. 

4. If you want unified support of your candidate if he or she wins, you should probably be prepared to do the same for other candidates (with an obvious exception for morality, but we don't have a Donald Trump figure running on our side...yet)

5. Let people speak for themselves. Absolutely zero people enjoy being told why they support or don't support someone. Ask questions and let people answer. 

6. We are very likely to have an absolutely absurd amount of people running in the Democratic primaries for 2020. The way things are going with all the hyperbole, we run the risk of dividing people into so many different artificial corners that the winner can possibly win with a plurality (let's say 25%), but with a decent chunk of Decmorats saying they'll never vote for him or her. This is at least half as likely to have more to do with something a supporter of theirs said than what the candidate actually said. You really actually need everyone's vote. If you're in the mindset that we don't need everyone's vote to win a national election, you haven't learned a single lesson from 2016. Do not alienate people. Don't assume that your perspective is popular or unpopular based on the reception of your social media circle.

Mr. Cummings will also ask Trump about how much money he made from foreign governments since Jan. 20,2017.","Yes, it seems surreal but true while thinking that Trump will receive a damning letter next week from Democrat Elijah Cummings, Chairman-Elect of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform demanding from Trump, his HHS Secretary Alex Azar, HS Secretary Kristen Nielsen and acting AG Mathew Whitaker, regarding ""the age, gender,country of origin and current location of every child who was separated from his or her parents under the Trump administration's immigration policy"" as per an article published in NYT today.

Mr. Cummings will also ask Trump and his stooges in a subtle way about his daughter Ivanka's use of ""nongovernment email accounts to conduct official business"" as Jason Zengerle informed us through his Op-Ed titled, ""These 3 Democrats Will Finally Have the Power to Investigate the White House. How Far Will They Go ?""

By the way, the other two Democrats in Jason's list are : Jerrold Nadler and Adam Schiff beside Mr. Cummings who'll have ""the authority to investigate a White House that is suspected of foreign collusion, conflicts of interest and mismanagement of the federal government."" from January 3rd, 2019 as per Mr. Zengerle's Op-Ed.

Trump's White House employees will also receive a letter from Mr. Cummings ""requesting information and documents about the use of government owned aircraft for personal travel and private aircraft for official travel"" as Jason explained in his long article.

Now, many of us know from recent news accounts that some of Trump's cabinet members and White House officials like Trump's Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, Ex-E.P.A. Administrator Scott Pruitt, Secretary of Treasury Steve Mnuchin et Al have used our government provided transportation to do their private business costing the taxpayers like us millions of dollars collectively.

But what Trump really have to worry is the letter that the Trump Organization will receive from Mr. Cummings ""asking for a complete accounting of all the payments it has received from foreign governments .....since his election""as we learned from the same Op-Ed.

And since he has so far refused to ""use a blind trust as past presidents had done ""as written in another Op-Ed in the NYT by Karen Yourish and Larry Buchanan titled, ""Trump Still Makes Money From His Properties_ Is This Constitutional ?"", Trump will be in a far worse situation than the two lawsuits that had already been filed against him last year by the ""attorneys general of Maryland and Washington D.C. and the other by the Democratic members of congress"" saying very clearly that 'The president has violated the foreign and domestic emoluments of the Constitution'' as we learned from the second article.

democrats,"Trump,after ripping off 8,000+renters by artificially inflating their rents in NYC in the '80s and '90s, wants to make billions more by invalidating Obamacare with the help of a crooked judge in Texas. His plan now is to sign new contracts with the Doctors and Hospitals under Trumpcare.","Yes, if a partisan judge from Texas thinks he can make the lives of 133 million people worse by removing their only healthcare that they gained through Obamacare, then that crooked judge should've never gone to a law school to become a jurist.

As a mater of fact that judge belongs to the same doghouse where his racist president belongs to.

Mr. Reed O'Connor should not be respected or referred to as a judge by the people going to his court.

Judge O'Connor rather deserves the ultimate anger and venom from the rest of the population of this country beside the millions of Americans who might lose their medical care if his judgement stands against the appeal by the State of California and 18 other states who made their oral arguments in front of him earlier to keep the A.C.A. as it is.

In ""A Partisan Ruling on Obamacare"" Christian Farias has presented more facts than we can handle about this terrible judgement by Judge O""Connor.

Mr. Farias also told us through his Op-Ed in today's NYT about where Trump and the Republicans stand on this horrible judgement by a partisan judge in Texas.

Yes, in case some Americans do not know yet, Trump and the crooked Republicans stand to gain billions of dollars by signing new contracts with all the doctors and hospitals and medical clinics and the insurance companies all over the country if somehow they can win this game of scrapping Obamacare and get it replaced by their own version of Trumpcare.

We know that Trump, who was always a crooked businessman along with his brothers and sisters, accepted this verdict very gleefully thinking how much money he personally would make from this huge turnover of a very popular healthcare known by his nemesis president Obama whom he hated from the core of his heart only because our last president was Black.

In another Op-Ed in today's NYT titled,"" As the Trumps Dodged Taxes, their Tenants paid a Price"", Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig have presented us with a mindset of Trump, his father and his siblings who fleeced thousands of their father's tenants in New York and other places by padding up their invoices of rendering small services in the entire apartment complex.

In the '80s and '90s New York, this crooked bunch extracted higher rents from their poor tenants living in Beach Haven Apartments in Brooklyn and other properties in Coney Island, Queens and Staten Island of NYC that his father Fred C. Trump owned by just submitting highly falsified invoices to the Rent Control Departments of New York.

""The padded invoices have been baked into the base rent used to calculate the annual percentage increase approved by the city"" is how Trumps fleeced their tenants as per the authors of this article.

No wonder Trump took this verdict from another racist judge like him from Texas, as a testament to his power over a section of the population who dislike anything Obama had achieved as the president only because of the dark color of his skin.

Trump also felt really happy inside from this judgement because of the way this verdict will pave the way for him to make more money than he ever made before.

But as we all know that this ruling by this partisan judge might be overturned by the United States court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit or the Supreme Court ,Trump has no reason to be bragging about anything out of this fiasco.

I am pro gun control, though, gun regulations are a must.

It's strange people misattribute gun control for banning all guns, when it's literally not that.

Anyways, with abortion.

Nobody in the Democratic party believes we should sneak up on women and shoot them with a patented Instant Abortion Ray^(TM). 

Abortions are unfortunate, nobody likes having them, nobody likes hearing they got a bad pregnancy and needs to abort their baby or they'd die with the baby.

but the choice of abortion is a must, just like the choice of owning a gun is a must.

Only a psychopath would become addicted to an abortion, but I've never heard a case of a woman getting 55 abortions in a year.

But, in the Vegas shooting, the shooter in question bought 55 guns in the past year.

democrats,Dems need to sort out the candidates,"Before I say anything, i’m just a high student who likes to dabble in politics so i’m not an expert remember that. I just saw the Iowa polling numbers and what the actual fuck is going on with these candidates. They aren’t running the candidates who will actually get them a win. IMO I think that any combo of POTUS/VPOTUS of Sanders, Ojeda, Beto or Yang  could probably wipe out Trump. Any other candidate is going to lose and that’s the bottom line, Dems needs candidates who appeals to people and the one’s I listed are pretty well liked. I need no explanation for Sanders, I think we all know about Sanders at this point. Ojeda is a people’s man and he can appeal to both sides with his vet experience. He is very much a champion of the people. The fact that he wasn’t on the ticket at Iowa was a fucking retarded move, people to need to find out about him because he is a strong candidate. Beto is a good politician but I don’t think he should be running for president right now, he needs to get a little more experience but I think he would be great for VP. However, if he does run I wouldn’t really be opposed to it. Beto could also probably flip Texas to blue considering that he almost made it blue during midterms, especially with more people moving down there it’s just gonna get more purple. Yang is interesting because his platform is pretty much based on revamping the economy with his big thing being universal basic income of 1k a month for 18-64 yr olds. Yang doesn’t have experience with politics but he is making an effort to become more educated in it on top of that he is building traction going to multiple democratic conventions and is already campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire. These 4 guys probably could beat Trump but the democratic party to needs to get it’s fucking shit together and realize what it’s got before they fuck shit up again like when they had a massive boner for shit for brains Clinton, and look what that got them.

What our Russia helped president has to worry about is what his longtime associate/lawyer/fixer Michael Cohen is going to say in a little more than three months of time than what he has already said to Mr. Mueller.

We can bet that Mr. Cohen'll say a lot more before he is sent to a federal prison on money laundering and campaign finance violations' charges.

In two Op-Eds in today's NYT, one by Abby Goodnough and Robert Pear titled ""Texas Judge Strikes Down Obama's Affordable Care Act as Unconstitutional"" and in another one by Frank Bruni titled,""Michael Cohen Got Wise, Will America ?"", all the columnists were of the opinion that Trump is entering into a very dangerous phase of his presidency.

If he thinks he won something big that he campaigned for after the Texas Judge scratched off the entire A.C.A., then Trump is just using the distraction to cover his anxiety which is raising his blood pressures to the highest level ever thinking what more Michael Cohen could say to Mr. Mueller to stop going to the prison for three years.

So we as Americans have to know that even if the Affordable Care Act or as it's commonly known by ""Obamacare"", is nullified by the Supreme Court after the appellate court in New Orleans nullifies the ruling by the Texas judge, Trump has no reason to smile.

He has to know that it is not unconstitutional to charge a sitting president by the Special Counsel's office irrespective of the ruling by the Justice Dept as many legal scholars have opined in many newspapers like NYT and WP or Wall Street Journal as well as on television news cycle. 

So if this Russian stooge in the White House feels happy after taking away basic medical care from 20 million Americans and hurting another 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions that they gained under Obamacare then Trump's happiness will be very short lived.

With Michael Cohen's long incarnation away from his wife and two children due around the same time when Justice Robert's S.C.O.T.U.S. might hear the oral arguments against the A.C.A., Trump might enter into a double whammy phase of his life around the same month of March, 2019.

Unless he offers to Mr. Cohen a gazillion of dollars, his go to guy and longtime fixer who did his boss's ""dirty deeds"" till October, 2016, will sing to Mr. Mueller and tell him each and every details about his boss's collusion with Russia to get either a reduced sentence or no jail time at all.

I can't help but say that most probably Trump's reign will come crashing down as soon as the year of 2019 begins.

We know that Trump, who didn't want to divest his personal wealth from the presidency on Jan 20th, 2017, rode through a parade of money making schemes milking his presidency, will be forced to distance himself completely from his Trump Inc. in 2019 if he wants to stay in power.

With only two companies in U.S, Apple and Amazon in the trillion dollar status, Trump Organization will be the third corporation that will surpass all other companies in U.S. and the world if Trump gets his four years of reign.

But the question that comes to everyone's mind is, ""Will Trump's presidency survive beyond 2018 ?""

Trump might think in a positive way that he'd finish his next two more years of office plus four more years starting on January 21, 2021. 

His Republican cohorts in congress might think too that their president will survive the bloodbath that will follow him for two more years while it engulfs the House of Representatives as soon as the New Year heralds.

But with very young and diverse members of the Democratic party cramming many of the congressional committees, it'll be worth noting how long Trump's personal lawyers will keep on sending the subpoenas back to the House Committees that'll be headed for the first time in eight years by our Democratic House members.

But what Trump has to worry most, is the power of the House Ways and Means committee Chairwoman : Maxine Waters .

A House member since 1991 from 43rd District of Los Angeles, California, Ms. Waters will wield the most coveted powers on Jan 3rd, 2019.

We can bet that she'll send a subpoena to Trump right on her first day of business asking him to show his tax returns for the last ten years.

So if 2018 ended with a sour note for Trump, just imagine what the beginning of 2019 will mean for Trump : A Total Disaster.

As Mr. Muller's investigation is nearing it's end, our sleazy president should presume that the name of the Special Counsel's final target is Donald J. Trump.","I'm quite sure that the only wall that Trump should build now is outside his bedroom in the White House.

And since his current residence is an U.S. Govt property, our prosecutors have the right to break down any wall that Trump erects without approval from the appropriations committee in the congress.

After Michael Cohen was sentenced yesterday for three years and Trump not going to help him even after his fixer promised earlier to ""take a bullet on Trump's behalf"", proved only one thing that for Mr. Mueller, ""Trump is next.""

Having lied on the questions that the Special Counsel had asked him in the long questionnaires, Trump has literally implicated himself under our perjury laws.

Now it's up to Robert Mueller whether to charge Trump as an 'unindicted co-conspirator' which the prosecutors in the Watergate scandal did to Nixon in 1974 or simply charge him with at least 34 counts of 'obstruction of justice' which will be legal as per many legal scholars irrespective of the post Watergate Justice Dept. rules that ""a sitting president cannot be charged while in office.""

As we came to learn from an Op-ed in NYT yesterday that a team of legal scholars in the Justice Dept. had expressed their opinion in 2000 that ""A president is not immune from legal proceedings for crimes committed before or after he or she assumed presidency"", I do not know why Trump cannot be charged now for committing a felony just to win his election in 2016 and then lying about it again and again from the White House.

And with an Editorial in today's NYT titled, "" His Dirty Deeds"", the editors have given us a very truthful account of what happened in the courtroom of Judge William Pauley yesterday where the Judge sentenced Mr. Cohen to 3 years of prison calling his actions a ""veritable smorgasbord of crimes"".

The same judge also indicated to all that Mr. Cohen and David Pecker who paid $280,000 to two women among themselves around October, 2016 have now admitted in court papers that they did it ""to help elect Mr. Trump president, and with his cooperation"".

That's the reason why I hope our sleazy president builds not one wall outside his bedroom but another wall with layers of thick steel in the White House after he listens to the old song by Inner Circle, ""Bad Boy, Bad Boy, what you gonna do, when they come for you."""

democrats,"Trump who never studied anything doesn't realize that our Constitution never said that a sitting president cannot be charged. Even the legal Counsel in the Justice Dept. acknowledged that ""nothing in the text of our Constitution precludes a grand jury indictment of a sitting president.""","We as true Americans can guess that the only advice Trump is getting right now from Rudy Giuliani is ""Sit tight, my friend. Nobody can indict you while you're sitting in the White House.""

But as Marty Lederman pointed out in his Op-Ed in today's NYT ""The Constitution wouldn't forbid an indictment, even during his presidency"", Trump should worry.

After reading Marty's article titled ""Would Indicting Trump Be Constitutional ?"", we can take a guess that the advice that Trump is getting from his other lawyers is the same like what Mr. Giuliani is giving to his long time friend Trump, "" Sit tight Mr. President. Mr. Mueller doesn't have the power to charge you as per Justice Dept . guidelines since the Watergate scandal.""

As per Mr. Lederman's column, "" The United States Attorney General will not allow the Justice Department to prosecute the president while he's in office"" but that should not stop us from speculating.

We should listen to Marty who informed us through his Op-Ed that as per his knowledge of all the legal loopholes while working at the Office Of Legal Counsel in 2000, Trump should be aware of what the Legal Counsel in the Justice Dept. acknowledged in the same year of 2000 ""that nothing in the text of the constitution or evidence of the framer' intent would preclude a grand jury indictment of a sitting president.""

So in that context Trump can and should be indicted now by either Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein or any other lower level Justice Dept officials other than the acting AG Mathew Whitaker, right after Mr. Mueller's handing over his sentencing guidelines to the sentencing judge in Michael Cohen's case.

We heard what Mr. Mueller wrote in that brief to the judge that a person whom he named as ""Individual 1"" who directed his lawyer/fixer Michael Cohen to make hush payments to two of out of many sexual partners of the Republican candidate for presidency in the month of October, 2016, just one month before the presidential election which concluded on Nov. 8th of the same year.

Even the prosecutors in the courts of the Southern District of New York mentioned in their sentencing guidelines to another judge about a real culprit known as ""Individual 1"" who used Michael Cohen as a conduit between him and 2 of his mistresses to pay off right before the election in 2016 because he thought he'd lose his election if the Religious Right groups or the White Evangelicals came to know that their chosen candidate is a philanderer who was cheating on his wife nursing a six month old baby boy at their home in Trump Tower.

And as we became aware now of who that ""Individual 1"" is, Trump should be aware that Mr. Mueller can and most probably will remove the word ""Individual 1"" from his indictment papers to the congress and write Trump's name ""as an unindicted co-conspirator --as it did with Richard Nixon in 1974"" as Marty informed us in his Op-Ed."

They've to realize that Robert Mueller has enough evidence right now to charge Trump as a 'co-conspirator' not just for violating the 'Campaign Finance Law"" but also for colluding with Russia.

Trump and his lawyers might think foolishly that Trump will be okay even with the mountain of evidence against him and his campaign team since the Special Counsel can never charge Trump because of the Justice Dept directives since Watergate that a sitting president cannot be charged with any crime.

But those idiots have to realize that the upcoming Dem majority House can do what Mr. Mueller cannot : To charge Trump with 'Obstruction of Justice'.

Trump and his lawyers can be sure that our new Dem House members will definitely start the impeachment proceedings after Jan. 3rd, 2019 with the latest revelations from Mr. Mueller in their hands.

Although there is no doubt in my mind or in the mind of Mr. Mueller that Trump has committed a criminal felony but I like many other legal scholars think that it'll be most effective if Trump is charged only by the Dem controlled House in the Congress, no one else.

That mindset is also present in the minds of the federal prosecutors from the southern district of New York who're more than 100% sure that ""Individual 1"", which in this case is Trump who'd broken the campaign finance law which is a felony when he directed his lawyer/fixer Michael Cohen in the wee hours of 2016's presidential campaign to pay off two women who claimed to have extra-marital affairs with the Republican candidate for presidency, as per an Op-Ed in today's NYT by Michelle Goldberg appropriately titled ,""The Presidency or Prison.""

Now the question that comes to the minds of all the legal scholars is, ""Is this act by Trump an impeachable offence ?""

Or ""Does it come under the violation of 'campaign finance law' ?""

If John Edwards trial of 2005 is any indication, then this act, of paying off a mistress or mistresses, which both Mr. Edwards did before and Trump now acknowledges grudgingly, is definitely of a criminal nature.

Every Americans should know that these illegal actions were taken in the closing moments of campaigns which both Edwards and Trump did only to stop the disruption in the presidential campaigns which in Trump's case was about to end in a month's time before his illegal win on November 8th, 2016.

If we remember what Gary Hart did in his bid for Democratic nomination in 1987 in his boat appropriately named ""Monkey Business"", was a glowing example of how a presidential campaign could drown with just one affair with a mistress.

Either Trump knew about Mr. Hurt's downfall or it was Mr. Cohen who reminded him that if he didn't pay these two women, his presidential campaign would hit rough waters.

Trump wisely paid off. 

But being such a cheap businessman, he paid off from the campaign funds thus violating the campaign finance rules.

But now since Mr. Mueller is looking into Trump's Russia connection as well, it is just a mater of time when Trump's lawyers will be hauled to the floors of the Dem controlled House after Jan. 3rd next year to explain why Trump should not be impeached.

And with Mr. Mueller and the ex-F.B.I. Director James Comey testifying under closed door,s Trump's reign in the White House will be very short lived as evidence after evidence of Russian hackers extracting every bit of information from Hillary and her campaign chief John Podesta's computers.

Our new Dem members of the House will hear how and when Ms. Clinton's campaign strategies including all her schedules and locations of her campaign stops were handed over to Trump campaign so that the Russian puppet sitting in the White House could outsmart Hilary by showing up in her turf before she could even begin her journey to those destinations.

And that will lead to only one conclusion : Trump willfully violated the trust of the American people ""who desired a particular outcome to the election by knocking on doors, toiled at phone banks"" as Michelle quoted the prosecutors from the southern district of New York who concluded that the ""Individual 1"" deliberately colluded with the Russians to win his election in 2016."

As per Mr. Mueller, Trump violated not just one ""Obstruction of Justice"" infraction but several point blank cases of ""High Crimes and Misdemeanor"" too.

The leading case among Trump's infractions is under our ""Espionage Act"".

If Ethel and Julius Rosenberg could be executed in 1953 on espionage charges for handing over our top-secret information about radar, sonar and jet propulsion engines beside transmitting valuable nuclear weapon designs and other naval secrets to the Soviet Union, then Trump should at least be charged for inviting the Russian counter-intelligence officials to hack into our nation's computer network.

If he thinks his public invitation to Russian hackers was only related to Hillary's private server, then he's fooling himself.

We all heard Trump pleading to the Russian govt. at a press conference in 2016 at his golf club at Doral, Florida to find out 30,000 classified emails from Hillary's computers.

Didn't he know then what 'Classified emails"" mean ?

Asking a foreign power especially our 70+ year old enemy Russia to extract governmental communications from a former Secretary of State's computers is not just dumb, it's criminal.

So with  Brazil and South Korea's ex-presidents languishing in jails for a long time on graft and corruption charges, America being the beacon of hope among the free world should be allowed to put it's own president in the prison for a long time too for similar charges plus lot more sinister than just graft and corruption charges.

Since we know now that as per Mr. Mueller's filing notes, Trump himself was engaged in unlawful activities to gain his presidency, I really wonder why our justice dept should hinder Mr. Mueller's real intention that is to charge Trump with several criminal infractions while he's still siting in the White House.

If a former presidential candidate John Edwards could be taken to the court for similar unlawful campaign payments violations to his former mistress, Trump's fat behind should at least be dragged to the court right now for paying off women out of his campaign funds to silence their mouths before the 2016 presidential election after both of those women told his campaign team that their future president had improper sexual encounters with them while he was still married to his wife Melania and a father of a six month old boy named Baron.

Although it's true that none of these two women, who were paid  hush money right before the 2016 presidential elections by either Michael Cohen or the editor of a sleazy magazine called National Enquirer, were pregnant like Mr. Edwards' girlfriend was, but the idea that the campaign money was paid to gain their silence should be taken into account just what our Dem vice presidential candidate of 2004 was charged with.

As per the Special Counsel's charging sheet to the judge for Cohen's sentencing, an individual whom he mentioned in the court paper as ""Individual 1"" directed his one time lawyer/ fixer to make the ""hush payment"" from the campaign funds donated by a Ukrainian businessman who paid $150,000 towards Trump's presidential campaign.

Now if somebody in America still doesn't know who that ""Individual 1"" is, I'll sell him or her the Empire State Building.

Of course it's Donald J. Trump, dummy.

But we as patriotic Americans also have to pay attention now about what Mr. Mueller says next about Trump's collusion with Russia.

To get a glimpse of what the Special Counsel is going to say next, all the Americans should go back in time and find out about what Nixon did after he bugged his opponent George McGovern's and D.N.C.

Yes, in case somebody didn't hear it yet, Republican president Nixon listened to each and every campaign strategies that Mr. McGovern discussed with his campaign team for his 1972's presidential election.

Once we do that we'll find out that's exactly what Trump did with his opponent's campaign manager John Podesta's emails that the Russians hacked at his request.

There is no doubt in my mind or Mr. Mueller's mind that Trump learnt everything about Hillary team's campaign strategies from those stolen emails, right to the locations of her next campaign stops."

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/upshot/wisconsin-republicans-rural-urban-voters.html?fbclid=IwAR07Oy2TUV0Z--xu1p14FJvf_IGu2TypslOhpXH4GAqeCd7n2j8PG20ErRU

Next time tornadoes rip rural areas in tornado alley a new rectal cavity, Senators and representatives from urban states and areas, particularly those that were left twisting in the wind after Hurricane Sandy because some rural folks got their panties in a wad over whether or not FEMA was Constitutional, should hold up FEMA relief in the same fashion. Let Billy Bob twist in the wind.

It's vindictive but I'm legit tired of hearing about the urban/rural divide, as though urbanites share an equal amount of blame in this nonsense. Sure, we might be a little bit overbearing when it comes to political correctness (the recent fight over Baby It's Cold Outside for example), but I don't remember any urban folks suggesting that rural folks' votes should count for less (outside of Twitter trolls). 

But I remember during the late 90's/early 00's when urban America was decimated by outsourcing. The rural representatives said that if the government intervened on our behalf (make outsourcing harder), it would be one step away from Soviet Communism. But intervening to help red rural America was A-OK. 

I'm tired of rural folks screaming that the Feds should only do exactly what's in the text of the Constitution and nothing more when it comes to helping us city folks but when it comes to helping themselves, they get more flexible. Trump was elected on the basis of saving rural coal communities. They should be left to sink or swim like the cities were."

The Special Counsel has made it very clear that by paying 2 women through Mr. Cohen right before his election, Trump broke the Campaign Finance Law.","Trump who's still under the illusion that 53 Senate Republicans will not allow his impeachment even if the majority of the Democrats impeach him in the House in 2019, then there is no other fool in this world other than him.

Although it's true that the charges filed against his campaign surrogates, mainly his one time lawyer/ fixer Michael Cohen does not implicate Trump directly yet reaching up to the thresh hold of 'High Crimes ans Misdemeanor"" as the framers of the Constitution had stipulated for impeaching a president but Trump should realize that if he was not the president he could be charged by the Grand Jury in 30 minutes for the same offenses that he and his campaign team have committed to make him win.

So for the American voters who still have some doubts about the culpability of their current president who openly flouted our  election laws and our Espionage Act, Peter Baker and Nicholas Fandos have given a very clear narrative in their Op-Ed in today's NYT titled "" Prosecutors' narrative Is Clear : Trump Defrauded Voters. But What Does It Mean ?""

While reading through their finely written article, I definitely came to the conclusion, so can all the Redditors that Trump has crossed all the norms and decency that a Chief Executive of our country should display to get our respects.

He not only flouted the campaign Finance law but he and his campaign team had gone overboard to court the Russian politburo members who had close ties to their president Putin. 

What Trump and his close campaign team members did, for which one of them George Papadopoulos is currently languishing in prison while another fat cat called Paul Manafort is awaiting sentencing in March next year while confined in a federal jail,was similar to what Nixon did and resigned for in 1974.

It should be very clear to all the Americans that Trump's intention to use the Russian hackers to extract Hillary's emails from her computer was not to find the classified emails which he knew was just a ruse because there were none.

In fact Trump campaign surrogates including Roger Stone told their Russian contacts who were in fact high level Russian govt. officials to hack into Hillary and her Campaign Chief John Podesta's computers beside the D.N.C. national headquarters' computers.

The idea behind this move was the same what Nixon told his associates to do and recorded foolishly in his White House tapes : To find out the campaign strategies of his opponent.

Just like Nixon won in a landslide in 1972's presidential election, Trump won more than 300 electoral votes by reading through his opponent Hillary's  campaign strategy emails.

If we recall, Trump went to all the states where Hillary was planning to go and campaign in the wee hours of 2016's presidential election.

In fact Trump went ahead of Hillary's trip to Michigan and other states to blunt Hillary's impact before her visits in all the cities and towns where Hillary could garner lot of votes through her personal connection with the voters of those states due to her unique campaigning style.

But there is no suspense anymore that Trump did all those campaigning in all of Hillary's favorite states only because of his advance knowledge of Hillary travel curriculum.

Trump went to Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, the two states he knew beforehand due to Russian hacking that Hillary was not planning to visit .

The rest is history."

democrats,"Only a stupid person like Trump can think that last night's filing by Mr. Mueller cleared him as a suspect. What he doesn't realize is that ""he's toast"" as most of us think now.","If Trump thinks that the latest developments,""totally clears the President""as he tweeted last night with ""Thank You."" in the end, then he's totally wrong.

He's in fact ""toast"" as many legal observers of the current  situations have commented on tv last night.

With his latest court filings yesterday, the Special Counsel Robert Mueller has made no secrets about who the ""Individual 1"" is ?

It is Trump.  And Trump alone constitutes the entire Russia Inquiry and the violator of the Campaign Finance Law.

As per Mr. Mueller, Trump alone ""directed payments to two women who claimed they had affairs with him"" to his fixer and lawyer Michael Cohen , as Barry Berke, Noah Bookbinder and Norman Eisen mentioned in their Op-Ed appropriately titled "" Is This the Beginning of the End for Trump ?"", in today's NYT.

Now the challenge for us as the citizens of this great country is how to put this Russian stooge in the prison.

We all know that as per Justice Department's directive , ""A sitting president cannot be charged with any criminal offence.""

For that matter, Trump can only be charged after he leaves the office.

And with the statute of limitations expiring in 2022, Trump can only be impeached while he's still in office.

But with 53 Republicans controlling the Senate next year, we cannot repeat the same pressure on a sitting president that we the Democrats put on their Republican colleagues in the U.S. Senate  in 1974 when our party had control of both the House and the Senate.

So as we speak now, it'll be a herculean task of removing Trump from office for both violating the campaign finance regulations and conspiring with a foreign enemy, in this case our worst enemy of all time Russia to turn a surefire win for his opponent Hillary into a victory speech for himself in the Trump Tower on the night of November 8th, 2016.

But with another scathing report from Mr. Mueller, stating clearly what Trump himself had done to undermine our national security when he conspired with the Russians to change the 2016 election outcome, maybe we can do it. 

Yes, maybe we can remove Trump from office by putting immense pressures on the Republicans to ask Trump to resign now or else lose their Senate majority beside the House and the White House in 2020.

All we need is that those audio tapes that Mr. Mueller has in possession after Mr. Comey left them behind in the F.B.I. Headquarters in Washington after he was unceremoniously fired by Trump in May of last year.

It'll really be a shocking experience for all of us to listen to Trump's nefarious activities in his own voices.

One of the most damning experiences for us will be listening in Trump's voice in the background in a tape where he was dictating the words to his then nominated National Security Director Michael Flynn to tell the Russian Ambassador to U.S. Sergei Kislyak that he as president would withdraw all the sanctions that then President Obama was putting on Russia on that day of December 27th, 2016.

If some Americans still have not heard this news yet, that promise from Trump was a payback for the total Russian counter-intelligence officials' help in extracting all of Hillary's campaign related emails from her campaign computers.

If we remember correctly that illegal action by the Trump campaign and the Russian hackers was just like what Nixon did in 1971 when he sent 6 of his henchmen to put a bug in his opponent George McGovern's campaign related phones in the D.N.C. Headquarters in the Watergate Hotel in Washington D.C.

Most probably Mr. Comey and Mr. Mueller know that Trump studied and copied the same M.O. that Nixon used to win his election in 1972. 

The only difference is : Nixon used American citizens to do his dirty work while Trump used the crooks from our nation's cold war enemy formerly called Soviet Union or Russia as they call themselves now.

While denouncing all the immigrants coming to our country, Trump is knowingly hiring a bunch of 'undocumented workers' from the same south American countries for his businesses, where he says MS-13 gang members come from .","It seems like Trump, who might've used more than a million lies in his his 72 years of turbulent life, is also a top notch hypocrite beside being a con man and a snake oil salesman.

Having used undocumented polish workers in the 80's to build his Trump Tower, Trump is still using  'undocumented workers' whom he refers to now as 'illegal immigrants' to his followers, as recently as last month in his Golf Club in Bedminster,N.J. 

As per an Op-Ed in today's NYT, titled,' Making President Trump's Bed : a Housekeeper Without Papers"", Ms. Miriam Jordan has given a first-hand account of Victoria Morales who was working as a personal maid of our so called president cleaning his dirty toilets and tidying up his soiled bed beside doing many other menial jobs for a low pay till last week.

We can bet that Trump didn't want to hire any ""Born In The U.S.A."" girl to clean his toilet because no White American girl would make his bed and do all other dirty things in his Golf Club for a low paycheck which is not worth taking so much of shit from him which these 'undocumented workers', some from the so called ""shithole countries"" that he described earlier who accept so much of abusive behaviors  from him and his supervisors' .

Each and every citizens of our country should know that Trump, the No. 1 hypocrite of our country, got his presidency using all kind of dirty names for the Mexicans and also for the people of Honduras, El-Salvador and Guatemala where Ms.Morales came from.

I should not forget here the name of another country called Costa Rica where another undocumented woman called Sandra Diaz who was also featured in Ms. Jordan's article came from beside hundreds of other undocumented maids who're still working in Trump Org. without any valid documents.

By calling thousands of desperate migrants fleeing 3 countries in the Central America in Caravans as ""very violent people with most of the men are MS-13 gang members"", Trump has created a mass hysteria just to please his hardcore uneducated supporters who cannot even point out in a map about where Guatemala or Honduras or El- Salvador is located.

But their president had no problem in hiring all the Spanish speaking people from South America because they work for the lowest pay checks that he wants to pay to his employees, not caring whether they're in this country legally or not.

Talk about this hypocrite's motto, ""Buy American. Hire American.""

What is missing from the current news is that maybe one of these women making his bed also got pregnant just like what California's last republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger did with his baby sitter after he was caught with making 3 babies with her while his wife Maria Shriver was busy reading news on national tv.

Or maybe we might hear one day about Trump making secret child support payments to one of these ""undocumented worker' women from Guatemala or El-Salvador just like what another racist and segregationist Republican Senator from South Carolina called Strom Thurmond was doing til his death on June 26,2003 making secret child support payments to a Black woman while condemning all the Black and minority people of America.

That'll be some news for all of Trump's supporters in particular and all the Americans in general if we ever hear that Trump was making secret child support payments after making babies with the 'undocumented women' coming from countries where he says MS-13 gang members come from.

That news will seal the deal for our so called hateful president who'll always be known thereafter as ""The most hypocrite human being of all time."""

democrats,Trump's election in 2016 should be declared null and void after a huge voter fraud was detected in a latest NC House election. Probably there were millions of 'absentee ballots' that were illegally mailed in for Trump's election by his White Republican voters who were not eligible to vote.,"Yes, it's about time that our national election officials declare Trump's election illegal because of thousands of non-eligible voters who voted for Trump through 'Absentee Ballots' in 2016, just like they did it in North Carolina in a House election last month.

Trump, who promoted the idea of voter fraud after he lost the popular votes to Hillary by more than 3 million votes, didn't mention about rigging of his own election by White uneducated Republican voters who voted through 'absentee ballots' by mail even after they knew that they were not eligible to vote because of their past felony records.

We now know that a real culprit and a convicted felon named Leslie McCrae Dowless in the affidavits filed by the NC Elections Board who doomed the chances of Democrat Dan McCready in the latest House election of the state through ""extensive ballot harvesting"", as Gail Collins have reported in her Op-Ed in today's NYT appropriately titled ""Trump Gets It All Wrong"".

This crooked guy Dowless made all the crooked things possible to make a North Carolina Republican pastor Mark Harris win the House race by 905 votes.

I'll bet all my  money that the same convicted felon in NC and hundreds more convicted felons all over the country had their hands in fraudulently collecting 'absentee ballots' from Black and Minority residents of their states including the Native Americans and filled out those forms themselves marking Trump's name as the president.

Not to mention that these crooks mailed in those illegal ballots to their respective state election offices in 2016's presidential election just like what they did in NC last month.

Trump who won North Carolina, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Florida by couple of thousands of votes in 2016 was immensely helped by these crooked operatives who signed those 'absentee ballots' calling themselves as  eligible voters by themselves and also signed the lines which said ""Signatures of the  Witnesses"" as the election law all over the country requires.

That is the reason why the Trump and the Republicans should start looking at their own Devils like Leslie Dowless and Ginger Eason of NC who was paid $75 to $100 to pick up the ""so called ballots"" for for her boss, Dowless.

Redditors should know that this crooked guy Dowless was convicted of felony fraud and perjury in the 1990s.

Redditors should know that the NC Election Board has now collected enough information suggesting that the officials in the campaign in NC, including Republican Candidate Mark Harris himself, were aware of Dowless's activities.

We should also suggest to the officials of all the Election Boards all over the country that they should be aware that there were many crooked paid members of the Republican party and Trump who helped their president and other Republican Senators and House members to win their elections through the modus operandi : Collect ""absentee ballots"" with real names and addresses and real Social Security numbers from unsuspecting Black and minority voters and mail in those forms after ticking Trump's and Republican candidates' names.

It should be noted here that these crooks forged the signatures of the original voters and signed in the forms as if they're the original voters' themselves. These crooks also used bogus signatures for Witnesses too.

So it's not only the Redditors but all the Americans should be aware that the numbers of these crooks like Dowless all over the country are in the thousands if not in the millions who're larking around the Black and minority neighborhoods to collect fraudulent 'absentee ballots' forms from the Black and minority residents without their signatures to make their candidates in the Republican party win the elections just like what they did with Trump in 2016 and Mark Harris on November 6th this year in North Carolina.

And we as American citizens should be aware too that there are every reasons to think that many White Republicans with recent or past felony records have sent 'absentee ballots' on their own to their local election offices to make Mark Harris win now in North Carolina while made Trump win in 2016 in the same fraudulent way.

Although the election officials in NC has not certified Mr. Harris's win yet but they did make Trump win their state in 2016 with the same type of 'absentee ballots' that we're talking about at present.

Go figure !"

democrats,"We can all bet that Trump has no other options than to resign after Mike Flynn was given no jail time by Mr. Mueller for his total cooperation. Trump can no longer say,""I did not collude with Russia."" As per Mr. Flynn,""He did.""","Well it seems like Trump will be spending the Christmas this year at the Trump Tower as a private citizen after being forced to resign from presidency due to this new development where Michael Flynn is being recommended for no jail time by the Mueller's team for cooperating with the prosecutors about a very serious 'obstruction of justice' charge against his president.

Now, lot of people will ask, ""Why this news is so important ?""

The recommendation of no incarnation of Mr. Flynn, by Mr. Mueller to the federal ""Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the United District Court for the District of Columbia"" as Adam Goldman and Eileen Sullivan have mentioned in their Op-Ed in today's NYT titled, ""Flynn Was Key Cooperator and Deserves Little Prison Time, Mueller Team says"", is very significant.

Prosecutors have said that Trump's first national security adviser's ""33 years of military service"" should also be taken into account when Mr. Flynn is sentenced on Dec. 18th, as per the same article.

What that move by the Special Counsel signifies is that Mr. Mueller got what he wanted from Mike Flynn : His confession about a crime that he committed on Dec 27th, 2016 when he promised to Putin on Trump's behalf through the Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey L. Kislyak saying ,""My president Mr. Trump will lift the sanctions on your country of Russia that Obama is placing today.""

To everyone's surprise, Russia did not put any retaliatory sanctions on the United States that they never failed to do before this request from Trump's senior campaign honcho who started a wild chant against Hillary saying ""Lock Her UP"" in the Republican Party's convention in Cleveland,Ohio on July 19th,2016.

It is not known yet if Mr. Mueller has the tape of Mr. Flynn's conversation with Mr. Kislyak which Mr. Flynn alluded to a senior F.B.I. official in January, 2017 saying ,""I know the United States had been listening to Mr. Kislyak's calls"" as the same Op-Ed in today's NYT informed us .

But Trump better pray that the same tape with his voice in the background, which the ex-F.B.I. Director Mr. Comey probably recorded with a bug placed in the Russian embassy, is missing.

If not, Trump should call a moving company to send a truck to take all his belongings back to Trump Tower from the White House because that tape will reveal his complicity in undermining our national security by promising to override Obama's sanctions on Russia by lifting it when he took over as the president on Jan 20th, 2017.

The question that all of us should be asking him is : ""Why ?

Why be so good to our worst enemy ?""

Only Mr. Mueller knows the answer thanks to Mike Flynn's testimony."

democrats,Trump's Republican stooges in Wisconsin are about to make a terrible blunder today by passing a bill to strip the powers of their incoming Dem Governor and their state's Dem AG. They'll fail again in their crooked efforts just like they failed in 2016 to restrict voting by the Blacks and minorities.,"If a crooked Trump's crooked Republicans in Wisconsin Assembly and it's lame duck Republican governor Scott Walker think that they can get away with an unconstitutional measure by striping away the powers from their incoming Governor and a newly elected state Attorney General just because their state's residents have chosen Democrats to govern their state, then they should realize that the hands of the law are too wide.

We all remember how ""the United States Supreme Court sent the case back to the lower courts"", as Dan  Kaufman reminded us through his Op-Ed in today's NYT with an appropriate title,""Wisconsin Is About to Make a Huge Mistake"" after a federal judge ruled in 2016 that the gerrymandered maps were ""racially discriminatory"" as per Dan's column. 

The lower court also said in their judgement in 2016 that the Republican led Wisconsin state Senate and it's state Assembly had drawn those gerrymandered maps in such ways that it was ""so excessively partisan as to be unconstitutional"" as we learned from the same Op-ED written by Mr. Kaufman.

The crooked Republicans of the state of Wisconsin and their crooked counterparts in the national capitol in Washington  including their very crooked president Trump can be very sure that either the same federal judge from 2016's decision or a different judge in Wisconsin will declare tomorrow or the day after that this illegal efforts today, by the Republican state legislatures in Wisconsin to strip all the powers from their Dem Governor and their state Dem AG, who'll swear in on Jan 3rd next year, are not as per the wishes of our signers of the Constitution.

In fact Mr. Kaufman's next sentence says it all when he stated this,""The lame duck, heavily gerrymandered Republican Legislature plans to vote on Tuesday to limit the powers of the incoming governor and attorney general, who are---surprise---Democrats.""

In response to Dan's article, I've to say that those Republican led state legislatures from Wisconsin and from many other Republican led state legislatures from across the country should be aware that the Chief Justice John Roberts of our S.C.O.T.U.S. in Washington has recently admonished Trump by saying this, ""There is no Obama Judges or Bush Judges in our court systems"" after our stupid president Trump accused the judges sitting on our court system called the ""United States Courts for the Ninth Circuit"", a court of appeals located in San Francisco, CA as, ""Obama Judges."" 

I'll bet my money that although Justice Roberts is a Republican, and was appointed by George W. Bush, he's going to send this latest case from Wisconsin back to the lower federal court system saying ""the decision in this case by an impartial federal judge is final."""

And with Trump being on the ticket in 2020 it'll be prudent for most of the Republicans in the House and the Senate to stay home.

The honchos in the G.O.P. still do not want to do any course correction by writing an obituary for their humongous loss of the House majority to the Democrats in the midterms that ended almost a month back on November 6th.

Our Democrats who did a miracle by wining nearly 40 more seats after overcoming 23 seats deficit from the last election in 2016 fooled every pundits in the country.

But with every political stalwarts thinking on the line that the R.N.C. whose members hold current House majority would do some soul searching and appoint some women in their party old grumpy White males, the House Republicans did just the opposite.

To the complete surprise of Ms. Stefanik and Ms. Wagner or Ms. Ros_Lehtinen of Miami area, their Republican Party's House members voted to keep their party in the same mold as before bypassing all the women for the top leadership positions.

This action by Kevin McCarthy the incoming House minority leader told all those women why their party will have only 13 female House members for 2 years starting on Jan.3rd,2019.

These Republican women learnt the hard way that their party doesn't care for them neither for any Blacks or other minorities like Latinos and Asians.

Mr. McCarthy who was voted the Republican House minority leader in a few minutes of internal voting, didn't bat an eye before he appointed same old party honchos in all the leadership position , as Jonathan Martin informed us through his Op-Ed in today's NYT.

So if this is how the Republicans want to take over the House majority again in 2020, then they should start praying to whichever God they can find on the roadside because their current God called Trump is going to ruin their party again in 2 years time, this time permanently."

But listening to all the fake news spewed by the hosts of the Morning and the Nightly shows of Fox Tv channel in his U.S. Govt. provided tv set in the White House, we now know how Trump formulates his foreign policy as well as domestic politics.

Trump gets lot of suggestions from his crazies at Fox News about how to handle Mr. Mueller's Russia Inquiry which is nearing it's end with indictments after indictments being meted by the Special Counsel's office on a regular basis.

So it's really a sad state of affairs for a great country of ours where our criminal president gets his legal suggestions many times a day from a bunch of fake pundits doting the entire Fox Tv.

In case some of our concerned citizens who do not know yet, Trump watches Fox News till after 10 o'clock every morning sitting in front of the tv in his pajamas neglecting his official duties.

He does the same thing at night when his favorite co-conspirator Sean Hannity shows up with his outlandish claims against Mr. Mueller.

All the Americans should know that these leeches working for Fox Tv encourage and support Trump by constantly repeating their president's catch phrase :  ""Muller's Russia Inquiry Is a Witch Hunt"". 

Yes, these are the dirty tricksters who give Trump fodders for his next morning's tweets.

So, in the bargain we've a president who won his election only because of the total efforts of Putin and his team of top rated Russian hackers working in their counter intelligence units of G.R.U..

All our citizens should know that the collection of these top rated Russian hackers were known as Guccifer 2.0 with whom Trump's former No.2 campaign official Roger Stone and his personal leech Jerome Corsi were coordinating the timing about when to dump all of Ms. Clinton's campaign related emails through Julian Assange of Wikileaks. 

Actually if we take Mr. Mueller's indictments of 24 Russian military intelligence officers and a ""Russian troll farm called the Internet Research agency"" as a road map as Quinta Jurecic wrote in an Op-Ed in today's NYT titled "" Robert Mueller Is No Match for Fox News"", then we can easily formulate our thinking that in fact Russian hackers were involved in hacking of all of Democratic Party emails with only one purpose in their President Putin's mind: To make Trump win.

But it is so heartbreaking now to listen to all our formerly ""Russia Foes"" including Lindsey Graham.

It seems like the republican Senator from South Carolina feels free now from the fear of the ghosts of the Russian threats to our democracy after his mentor John McCain died.

In fact Mr. Graham's current actions towards his president, who even his best friend in the Senate Mr. McCain thought to be in the pocket of the Russians, is weird, to be mild but horrendous to be exact.

It seems like Lindsey graham has also embarked on the same mission, just like Trump's stooges like Tucker Carlson of Fox Tv, to characterize the messenger, in this case the Special Counsel Robert Mueller as the rogue instead of Trump whom the daughter and wife of the late Senator from Arizona still hate for what the draft dodger with a 'phantom bone spur' Trump said about their father and husband ""The Maverick"" at a Town Hall meeting in 2015, ""I don't care for soldiers who're captured . Period !""

He might stand again next to Putin like in Helsinki and say,""Mr.Putin says he didn't meddle in our elections.And I trust his words.""","Yes, Trump was at his squalid self again yesterday at the summit in Argentina as well as before he left for his trip when he called Michael Cohen, his onetime fixer and dirty mob lieutenant,""A liar"" first.

Next he immediately contradicted himself from his campaign days by confessing that he wanted to pursue a hotel and casino business in Moscow while campaigning two tears back because ""there was a good chance I'd lose"", meaning he wanted to win something for himself even if he lost the one and only election of his life in 2016.

So it was really shocking for all the American citizens like us because all his current revelations came after he continuously denied throughout his campaign by lying openly when he said this, ""I've nothing in Russia. And I've never met Putin.""

That is the reason why all the Americans have to remember that all these potent lies came from a man who made a world record of uttering six thousand plus lies in less than two years since ascending to the presidency.

Well maybe there are many professional liars who're languishing in jails for lying more number of times than our Russia flipped head of state called Trump.

It should be noted here that Trump started lying more since he went to the White House.

And as the Justice Dept made a rule right after the Watergate scandal that a sitting president cannot be indicted for lying or committing any other acts of ""High Crimes and Misdemeanor"", all that our current Special Counsel Robert Mueller can do is taking his own time to finish writing his report and wait for a little more than 32 days till January 3rd next year.

I'll bet all my money that Mr. Mueller is doing just that of waiting to let this year go by and hand over his report to the new members of the House Judiciary committee in the congress to be headed by a Democrat rather than the current Republican Chairman David Nunes.

Like us on the left, Mr. Mueller knows what Mr. Nunes would do with that damning report ?

He'd go straight to the White House in the middle of the night like he did once before to hand over Mr. Mueller's report to his boss Trump who'll simply burn, the thousands of pages of the beautifully crafted report compiled by the prosecutors, in the gold colored fireplace of the Oval Room in the current White House."
